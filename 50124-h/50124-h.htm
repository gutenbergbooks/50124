<h2><a name="PREFATORY_NOTE" id="PREFATORY_NOTE">PREFATORY NOTE</a></h2>


<p>Whatever merit this Memoir may possess
it owes to Maitland and to the circle of
those who cherish his memory. My own disabilities
will be made plain to the reader, but, lest he entertain
false expectations, let me explain at the outset that I
was educated neither at Eton, nor at Cambridge, nor
at Lincoln's Inn, that I am no lawyer, and that I have
never received a formal education in the law. Finally,
I did not make Maitland's acquaintance till he was
in his thirty-seventh year. These are grave shortcomings,
and if I do not rehearse the long roll of
benefactors who have helped me to repair them, let it
not be imputed to a failure in gratitude. I cannot,
however, forbear from mentioning five names. Before
these sheets went to Press they were read by
Mrs Maitland, by Mrs Reynell, by Dr Henry Jackson,
by Dr A. W. Verrall and by Professor Vinogradoff.
To their intimate knowledge and weighty counsels I
owe a deliverance from many errors. Dr Jackson has
generously laid upon himself the additional burden of
helping me to see the volume through the Press.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I">I.</a></h2>


<p>The life of a great scholar may be filled with
activity as intense and continuous as that demanded
by any other calling, and yet is in the nature of things
uneventful. Or rather it is a story which tells itself
not in outward details of perils endured, places visited,
appointments held, but in the revelation of the scholar's
mind given in his work. Of such revelation there is
no stint in the case of Frederic William Maitland.
Within his brief span of life he crowded a mass of
intellectual achievements which, if regard be had to its
quality as well as to its volume, has hardly, if ever,
been equalled in the history of English learning. And
yet though a long array of volumes stands upon the
Library shelves to give witness to Maitland's work, and
not only to the work, but to the modest, brilliant and
human spirit which shines through it all and makes it
so different from the achievement of many learned
men, some few words may be fitly said here as to his
life and as to the place which he held and holds in our
learning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>He was born on the 28th of May, 1850, at 53 Guilford
Street, London, the only son of John Gorham
Maitland and Emma Daniell. Father and mother
both came of good intellectual lineage. John Gorham
Maitland was the son of Samuel Roffey Maitland, the
vigorous, learned and unconventional historian whose
volume on the Dark Ages, published in 1844, dissipated
a good deal of uncritical Protestant tradition. Emma
Daniell was the daughter of John Frederic Daniell, a
distinguished physicist, who became a Fellow of the
Royal Society at the age of twenty-three, invented the
hygrometer and published, as Professor of Chemistry
at King's College, a well-known <cite>Introduction to
Chemical Philosophy</cite>.</p>

<p>Such ancestry, at once historical and scientific, may
explain some of Maitland's tastes and aptitudes. Indeed
the words in which Dr Jessop has summarised
the work of Samuel Maitland might be applied with
equal propriety to the grandson. "Animated by a rare
desire after simple truth, generously candid and free
from all pretence or pedantry, he wrote in a style
which was peculiarly sparkling, lucid and attractive."
The secret of this stimulating and suggestive quality
lay in the fact that Samuel Maitland was a man of
independent mind who took nothing for granted and
investigated things for himself. In 1891 his grandson
wrote the following words to his eldest sister, who
asked whether their grandfather's works would live.
"Judging him merely as I should judge any other
literary man I think him great. It seems to me that
he did what was wanted just at the moment when it
was wanted and so has a distinct place in the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of history in England. The <cite>Facts and Documents</cite>
(illustrative of the History, Documents and Rites of
the Ancient Albigenses and Waldenses) is the book
that I admire most. Of course it is a book for the
few, but then those few will be just the next generation
of historians. It is a book which 'renders impossible'
a whole class of existing books. I don't mean physically
impossible&mdash;men will go on writing books of that class&mdash;but
henceforth they will not be mistaken for great
historians. One has still to do for legal history something
of the work which S. R. M. did for ecclesiastical
history&mdash;to teach men e.g. that some statement about
the thirteenth century does not become the truer
because it has been constantly repeated, that 'a chain
of testimony' is never stronger than its first link. It is
the 'method' that I admire in S. R. M. more even than
the style or the matter&mdash;the application to remote
events of those canons of evidence which we should all
use about affairs of the present day, e.g. of the rule
which excludes hearsay."</p>

<p>Cambridge and the bar were familiar traditions.
Samuel Maitland was a member of Trinity College,
Cambridge, who, having been called to the bar, abandoned
the professional pursuit of the law for historical
research. He took orders, became Librarian at
Lambeth, and ultimately retired to Gloucester to read
and to write. John Gorham, seventh wrangler, third
classic, Chancellor's medallist, crowned a brilliant undergraduate
career by a Fellowship in his father's college
and was then called to the bar, but finding little
practice drifted away into the Civil Service, becoming
first, examiner, and afterwards, in succession to his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
James Spedding, secretary to the Civil Service Commission,
which last office he held till his death in 1863,
at the age of forty-five. That he could write with
point and vigour is made clear by a pamphlet upon the
Property and Income Tax, published in 1853, but the
work of the Civil Service Commission must have left
little leisure for writing, and early death cut short the
career of a man whose high gifts were as remarkable
to his friends as was the modesty with which he veiled
them from the world<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Frederic William, too, passed
from Cambridge to the law and then away to work
more congenial to his rare and original powers.</p>

<p>Of direct parental influence Maitland can have
known little. His mother died in 1851 when he
was a baby, and twelve years afterwards, six months
before a Brighton preparatory school was exchanged
for Eton, he and his two sisters were left fatherless
and the sole charge of the family devolved upon
Miss Daniell the aunt, who stood in a mother's place.
Dr Maitland, the historian, lived on till 1866 and his
home in Gloucester, still called Maitland House, was
from time to time enlivened by the visits of grandchildren.
The fair landscape of Gloucestershire&mdash;the
wooded slopes of the Cotswolds, the rich pastures of
the Severn Valley with the silver thread of river
widening into a broad band as it nears the Bristol
Channel, the magical outline of the Malvern Hills, the
blaze of the nocturnal forges in the Forest of Dean,
were familiar to Maitland's boyhood. Gloucestershire
was his county, well-known and well-loved. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
beautiful old manor-house of Brookthorpe, one of
those small grey-stone manor-houses which are the
special pride of Gloucestershire, stood upon the lands
which had come into the possession of the family
through the marriage of Alexander Maitland with
Caroline Busby in 1785. Round it in the parishes of
Brookthorpe and Harescombe lay "Squire Maitland's"
lands&mdash;a thriving cheese-making district until Canada
began to filch away the favour of its Welsh customers.</p>

<p>Maitland was at Eton from 1863 to 1869, but failed
to become prominent either in work or play. "He
played football, was for a while a volunteer, rowed so
much that he 'spoilt his style,' spent Sunday afternoons
in running to St George's chapel to hear the anthem,
and more than once began the holidays by walking
home to Kensington<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>." Long afterwards when the
question of compulsory Greek was being hotly debated
in the Senate House at Cambridge he spoke with
deep feeling of a "boy at school not more than forty
years ago who was taught Greek for eight years and
never learnt it ... who reserved the greater part of his
gratitude for a certain German governess ... who if he
never learnt Greek, did learn one thing, namely, to
hate Greek and its alphabet and its accents and its
accidence and its syntax and its prosody, and all its
appurtenances; to long for the day when he would be
allowed to learn something else; to vow that if ever he
got rid of that accursed thing never, never again would
he open a Greek book or write a Greek word<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>." We
imagine a shy, awkward delicate boy bursting into jets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>of wittiness at the least provocation, caring for things
which other boys did not care for, misliking the classics,
especially Greek, but "brought out by Chaucer" as his
tutor Mr E. D. Stone reports, and discovering some
taste for mathematics and a passionate interest in
music. One contemporary remembers his "jolly,
curiously-lined face"; another writes that he was regarded
as "a thoroughly good fellow," but his striking
originality of mind was perhaps only realised by one
schoolfellow, Gerald Balfour, who was the sharer of
many a Sunday walk and both at Eton and Cambridge
bound to Maitland by close ties of friendship. To the
masters Maitland presented none of the obvious points
of interest. Even William Johnson, that learned and
catholic scholar who made so many happy discoveries,
failed to discover Maitland. The boy was not a
Hellenist and his deficiencies in Greek and Latin
prosody put him outside the intellectual pale. He was
whimsical, full of eccentric interests, of puns and
paradox and original humour. His closest school
friend thought that he would possibly develop into
"a kind of philosophic Charles Lamb<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>."</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1869 Maitland went up to Trinity
College, Cambridge, as a Commoner. The learned
Samuel Roffey had been a musician both in theory and
practice, and the taste for music descended through the
son to the grandson. The first year of Maitland's
undergraduate life was given over to music, mathematics
and athletics; but his earliest distinctions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
gained not in the most but in the least intellectual of
these pursuits. Though he can never have looked
otherwise than fragile, he had outgrown his early
delicacy and become an active lad with considerable
powers of endurance. He won the Freshman's mile
in four minutes forty-seven seconds, excellent time as
records went then, and obtained his "blue" as a three-miler
in the Inter-University Sports. The two mile
walking race, the quarter, and the mile, fell to him at
various times in the Third Trinity Sports. Nor were
his athletic activities confined to the running path.
His friend Mr Cyprian Williams remembers his last
appearance as a racing oarsman; how on the final day
of the Lent races of 1872 the Third Trinity second
boat after a successful week made a crowning bump,
how in the moment of the victory the crew were tipped
over into the cold and dirty waters of the Cam, and
how in the evening the boat dined in Maitland's
lodgings over Palmer's boot-shop and kept up its
festivity well into the morning.</p>

<p>Long before this&mdash;at the beginning of his second
year at Cambridge&mdash;Maitland found his way into
Henry Sidgwick's lecture-room and made a discovery
which shall be told in his own words. "It is now
thirty years ago that some chance&mdash;I think it was the
idle whim of an idle undergraduate&mdash;took me to
Sidgwick's lecture-room, there to find teaching the
like of which had never come in my way before.
There is very much else to be said of Sidgwick;
some part of it has been beautifully said this afternoon;
but I should like to add this: I believe that
he was a supremely great teacher. In the first place I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
remember the admirable patience which could never
be out-worn by stupidity, and which nothing but
pretentiousness could disturb. Then there was the
sympathetic and kindly endeavour to overcome our
shyness, to make us talk, and to make us think.
Then there was that marked dislike for any mere
reproduction of his own opinions which made it impossible
for Sidgwick to be in the bad sense the
founder of a school. I sometimes think that the one
and only prejudice that Sidgwick had was a prejudice
against his own results. All this was far more impressive
and far more inspiriting to us than any
dogmatism could have been. Then the freest and
boldest thinking was set forth in words which seemed
to carry candour and sobriety and circumspection to
their furthest limit. It has been said already this
afternoon, but I will say it again: I believe that no
more truthful man than Sidgwick ever lived. I am
speaking of a rare intellectual virtue. However small
the class might be, Sidgwick always gave us his very
best; not what might be good enough for undergraduates,
or what might serve for temporary purposes,
but the complex truth just as he saw it, with all those
reservations and qualifications, exceptions and distinctions
which suggested themselves to a mind that
was indeed marvellously subtle but was showing us
its wonderful power simply because, even in a lecture
room, it could be content with nothing less than the
maximum of attainable and communicable truth.
Then, as the terms went by, we came to think of
lecture time as the best time we had in Cambridge;
and some of us, looking back now, can say that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
in a very true sense the best time that we have had
in our lives. We turned away to other studies and
pursuits, but the memories of Sidgwick's lectures lived
on. The matter of the lectures, the theories and the
arguments, might be forgotten; but the method remained,
the spirit remained, as an ideal&mdash;an unattainable
ideal, perhaps, but a model of perfect work. I
know that in this matter I can speak for others; but
just one word in my own case. For ten years and
more I hardly saw Sidgwick. To meet him was a
rare event, a rare delight. But there he always was:
the critic and judge of any work that I might be
doing: a master, who, however forbearing he might
be towards others, always exacted from himself the
utmost truthfulness of which word and thought are
capable. Well, I think it no bad thing that young
men should go away from Cambridge with such a
master as that in their minds, even though in a given
case little may come of the teaching ... I can say no
more. Perhaps I have already tried to say too much.
We who were, we who are, Sidgwick's pupils, need no
memorial of him. We cannot forget. Only in some
way or another we would bear some poor testimony
of our gratitude and our admiration, our reverence and
our love<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p>

<p>Such teaching was precisely calculated to ripen
Maitland's unsuspected powers. The pupil was as
modest, as exact, as truth-loving as the master, and
possessed a quick turn for witty casuistry which was
quite individual though not dissimilar to Sidgwick's
own gift in the same direction. Under Sidgwick's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
influence Maitland's intellect deepened and widened.
The piano was ejected from the college room; the
University running path knew him no more; mathematics
were abandoned for philosophy with such good
result that a scholarship was gained at Trinity, and
that in the Moral and Mental Science Tripos of 1872
Maitland came out at the head of the First Class,
bracketed with his friend W. Cunningham, who has
since won high distinction in the field of economic
history. But the chief prize of undergraduate ambition,
a Fellowship at Trinity, was denied him. Maitland
competed, and was beaten in the competition by James
Ward, now one of the most distinguished of living
psychologists. Examiners make fewer mistakes than
is commonly supposed, and on this occasion Henry
Sidgwick and Thomas Fowler reached their decision
not without hesitation. While admitting Maitland's
literary brilliance and facility they discovered in his
successful rival a deeper interest in the problems of
philosophy and therefore a superior claim to a Fellowship
in Moral and Mental Science<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Maitland's Fellowship dissertation entitled "A
Historical Sketch of Liberty and Equality as Ideals
of English Political Philosophy from the time of
Hobbes to the time of Coleridge" is, despite some
defects of proportion, a remarkable performance for so
young a man. Not only does it cover a wide range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of reading, especially in the English moralists, but
it is distinguished by two characteristic qualities&mdash;independence
of judgment and a scrupulous estimate
of the canons of proof. The scholar of Trinity says
many good things<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, but says nothing at random.
Even when it would have been tempting to sally
forth with a flourish of affirmation, he prefers to stand
within the zone of caution. "I am inclined to think,"
he writes, "(though there is great risk of such speculations
being wrong) that Hobbes was led to exaggerate
his account of man's naturally unsocial character by a
desire to bring the state of nature into discredit." One
cannot dogmatise about the motives of the dead; our
dogmas are but plausible hypotheses, and so complex
is human nature, so inexhaustible is life's casuistry that
the likeliest conjecture may fail of the mark. "There
is a great risk of such speculation being wrong."
Touches like this reveal the fact that the disciple of
Sidgwick had learnt his master's lesson.</p>

<p>The scholarship at Trinity, carrying with it a place
at the scholar's table, brought Maitland into communion
with the ablest men in the College. It often happens
that a youth who has attracted little attention at school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
by reason of his failure to satisfy the limited conventions
of schoolboy excellence, springs into sudden
prominence at the University. His conversation
attracts notice; his friends discover that he has original
opinions, or some peculiar charm of bearing, or that
his gifts of mind or character are out of the common.
So it was with Maitland. He soon achieved a reputation
not only as a witty and brilliant talker, but as
a charming companion and as the most original public
speaker of his time. He was elected to be a member
of the Apostles, a small society which for many
university generations has been a bond between clever
young Cambridge men and has brought them into
friendly relations with their seniors: and by the suffrages
of a larger and less select electorate he rose to
be Secretary and then President of the Union Society.</p>

<p>Maitland's speeches at the Union printed themselves
upon the minds of his audience as being very
effective for their immediate purpose and yet quite
unlike the speeches of ordinary vote-winners. His
artifice was all his own. Others were more eloquent,
more prompt in the cut and thrust of debate, but in
the power of condensing an argument into a surprising
phrase or epigram he stood alone. After his first
successful appearance as the advocate of the opening
of National Collections of Science and Art on Sunday
afternoons he became the favourite undergraduate
orator of his time. "You insist that we must keep the
Mosaic Law," he argued in his maiden speech, "but
under it a man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath
was stoned to death. Now I have picked up sticks on
Sundays. Will you in your consistency stone me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
On another occasion he delighted the House by
observing that at the Reformation the English State
put an end to its Roman bride but married its deceased
wife's sister. The shape of his opinions was frankly
radical and fashioned by a vehement enthusiasm for
free thinking and plain speaking. "There are two
things," he remarked, "which we have learnt by costly
experience that the Law cannot control&mdash;Religious
Belief and the Rate of Interest." Compulsory attendance
at College Chapel, Church Establishment, the
closing of the Cambridge Union on Sunday mornings
aroused his opposition and furnished the theme of
well-remembered speeches. "O Sir," he once exclaimed
to the President with outstretched hands,
"I would I were a vested nuisance! Then I should
be sure of being protected by the whole British
Public."</p>

<p>There is a pleasant story contributed by Professor
Kenny&mdash;to whom this portion of the narrative is
greatly indebted&mdash;of a debate upon a motion that
certain annotations upon the annual report of the
Union's proceedings should be cancelled in the
interests of "the literary credit of the Society." The
notes were ungrammatical, ludicrous, unauthorised.
They had been composed during the Long Vacation
by the Society's senior servant in the name of the
absent Secretary. There was nothing to be said for
them save that it was hard that a good old man should
be humiliated for an excess of official zeal. Maitland
was Secretary at the time and chivalrously undertook
the defence of his subordinate. It was the eve of
the Fifth of November; the name of the mover was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
James. Such an historical coincidence was not lost
upon the ingenious mind of the Secretary. "Tomorrow,"
he observed, boldly carrying the war into
the enemy's country, "is the Feast of the Blessed
Saint Guy. Appropriately enough the House appears
to be under search this evening for indications of a
new plot. Enter King James the Third, surrounded
by his minions, with a loud flourish of his own trumpet.
He produces the dark lantern of his intellect and
discovers&mdash;not a conspirator, but a mare's nest." And
when, at last, by successive strokes of humour Maitland
had won over the sympathies of the House, he proceeded
to venture upon the merits of his defence.
"We are attacked," he said, "for bad grammar. A
great crime, no doubt, in some men's eyes. For at
times I have met men to whom words were everything,
and whose everything was words; men
undistinguished by any other capacity, and unknown
outside this House, but reigning here in self-satisfaction,
lords of the realm of Tautology."</p>

<p>The failure to obtain a fellowship broke off any
design which may have been entertained of an
academic career, and Maitland, following the family
example, returned to London to try his fortune at
the bar. Men of high academic achievement sometimes
fail in the practical professions, by reason of
a certain abstract habit of mind or from an engrained
unsociability of temperament. Neither of these disad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>vantages
affected Maitland. A combined training in
philosophy and law had given him just that capacity
for deriving principles from the facts of experience,
and of using the facts of experience as the touchstone
of principles, which is essential to the adroit and
intelligent use of legal science; and for all his learning
and zeal there was nothing harsh and unsocial about
him. On the other hand he was completely deficient
in the moral alloy which appears to be an essential
element in the fabric of most successful careers. He
was entirely destitute of the arts of "push" or
advertisement, and so disinterested and self-effacing
that a world which is accustomed to take men at their
own valuation was not likely to seize his measure.</p>

<p>Maitland entered at Lincoln's Inn in 1872 and was
called to the bar in 1876, reading first with Mr Upton
and afterwards with Mr B. B. Rogers, the brilliant
translator and editor of Aristophanes. "I had only
one vacancy," writes Mr Rogers, "in my pupil room
and that was about to be filled by a very distinguished
young Cambridge scholar. But he was anxious&mdash;stipulated
I think&mdash;that I should also take his friend
Maitland. I did not much like doing so, for I
considered four pupils as many as I could properly
take, and I knew nothing of Maitland and supposed
that he would prove the crude and awkward person
that a new pupil usually is, however capable he may
be, and however distinguished he may become in later
life. However, I agreed to take him as a fifth pupil,
and he had not been with me a week before I found
that I had in my chambers such a lawyer as I had
never met before. I have forgotten, if I ever knew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
where and how he acquired his mastery of law; he
certainly did not acquire it in my chambers: he was a
consummate lawyer when he entered them. Every
opinion that he gave was a complete legal essay,
starting from first principles, showing how the question
agreed with one, and disagreed with another, series of
decisions and finally coming to a conclusion with the
clearest grasp of legal points and the utmost lucidity
of expression. I may add (and though this is a small
point it is of importance in a barrister's chambers) that
it was given in a handwriting which it was always a
pleasure to read. He must have left me in 1877, and
towards the end of 1879, my health being in a somewhat
precarious state, and my medical advisers insisting
on my lessening the strain of my work, I at once asked
Maitland to come in and superintend my business.
He gave up his own chambers and took a seat in mine
(the chambers in 3 Stone Buildings where I then was
are I think the largest in the Inn), superintended the
whole of my business, managed my pupils, saw my
clients and in case of necessity held my briefs in Court.
I doubt if he would have succeeded as a barrister; all
the time that I knew him he was the most retiring
and diffident man I ever knew; not the least shy or
awkward; his manners were always easy and self-possessed;
but he was the last man to put himself
forward in any way. But his opinions, had he suddenly
been made a judge, would have been an honour to the
Bench. One of them may still be read in Re Cope
Law Rep. 16 Ch. D. 49. There a long and learned
argument filling nearly two pages of the Report is put
into the mouth of Chitty Q.C. and myself, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><em>not one word
of which was ever spoken by either of us</em>. It was an
opinion of Maitland's on the case laid before us which
I gave to Chitty to assist him in his argument.... I
cannot close this long though hastily written letter
without expressing my personal esteem for the man.
Wholly without conceit or affectation, simple, generous
and courteous to everybody, he was the pleasantest
companion that anybody could ever wish for: and I
think that the three years he spent in my chambers
were the most delightful three years I ever spent
at the bar."</p>

<p>Working partly for Mr Rogers and partly for
Mr Bradley Dyne, Maitland saw a good deal of conveyancing
business and in after years was wont to
lay stress upon the value of this part of his education.
Conveyancing is a fine art, full of delicate technicalities,
and Maitland used to say that there could be no better
introduction to the study of ancient diplomata than a
few years spent in the chambers of a busy conveyancer.
Here every document was made to yield up its secret;
every word and phrase was important, and the habit
of balancing the precise practical consequences of
seemingly indifferent and conventional formulæ became
engrained in the mind. Paleography might teach men
to read documents, diplomatics to date them and to
test their authenticity; but the full significance of an
ancient deed might easily escape the most exact
paleographer and the most accomplished diplomatist,
for the want of that finished sense for legal technicality
which is the natural fruit of a conveyancing practice.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Business of this type, however, does not provide
opportunities for forensic oratory and Maitland's voice
was rarely heard in Court<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. But meanwhile he was
rapidly exploring the vast province of legal science,
mastering the Statute Books, reading Frenchmen,
Germans and Americans, and occasionally contributing
articles upon philosophical and legal topics to the Press.</p>

<p>To the deepest and most serious minds the literature
of knowledge is also the literature of power.
Maitland's outlook and ideal were at the period of
intellectual virility greatly affected by two books,
Savigny's <cite>Geschichte des Römischen Rechts</cite> and Stubbs'
<cite>Constitutional History</cite>. The English book he found
in a London Club and "read it because it was interesting,"
falling perhaps, as he afterwards suggested,
for that very reason "more completely under its
domination than those who have passed through
schools of history are likely to fall." Of the German
he used to say that Savigny first opened his eyes as
to the way in which law should be regarded.</p>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>Law was a product of human life, the expression of
human needs, the declaration of the social will; and so
a rational view of law would be won only from some
height whence it would be possible to survey the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>historic prospect which stretches from the Twelve
Tables and the <i lang="la">Leges Barbarorum</i> to the German
Civil Code and the judgments reported in the morning
newspaper. Readers of <cite>Bracton's Note Book</cite> will
remember Maitland's description of Azo as "the
Savigny of the thirteenth century," as a principal
source from which our greatest medieval jurist obtained
a rational conception of the domain of law. Savigny
did not write the same kind of book as Azo. He
worked in a different medium and on a larger canvas
but with analogous effects. He made the principles of
legal development intelligible by exhibiting them in
the vast framework of medieval Latin and Teutonic
civilization and as part of the organic growth of the
Western nations. Maitland's early enthusiasm for the
German master took a characteristic form: he began a
translation of the history.</p>

<p>The translation of Savigny was neither completed
nor published. Maitland's first contribution to legal
literature was an anonymous article which appeared in
the <cite>Westminster Review</cite> in 1879. This was not primarily
an historical disquisition though it displayed a width of
historical knowledge surprising in so young a man, but
a bold, eloquent, and humorous plea for a sweeping
change in the English law of Real Property. "Let all
Property be personal property. Abolish the heir at
law." This alteration in the law of inheritance would
lead to great simplification and would remove much
ambiguity, injustice and cost. Nothing short of this
would do anything worth doing. A few little changes
had been made in the past, "for accidents will happen
in the best regulated museums," but it was no use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
recommending timid subsidiary changes while the
central anomaly, the source of all complexity and confusion,
was permitted to continue. "It is not unlikely,"
remarked the author with grave irony, "that we are
behind an age whose chief ambition is to be behind
itself."</p>

<p>The article exhibits a quality of mind which is
worth attention. Maitland never allowed his clear
strong common sense to be influenced by that vague
emotion which the conventional imagination of half-informed
people readily draws from antiquity. He
loved the past but never defended an institution because
it was old. He saw antiquity too vividly for
that. And so despite the ever increasing span of his
knowledge he retained to the end the alert temper of
a reformer, ready to consider every change upon its
merits, and impelled by a natural proclivity of mind to
desire a state of society in some important respects
very different from that which he found existing. At
the same time he is far too subtle a reasoner to
acquiesce in the doctrinaire logic of Natural Rights or
in some expositions of social philosophy which pretended
to refinements superior to those provided by
empirical utilitarianism. Two early articles contributed
to the pages of <cite>Mind</cite> on Mr Herbert Spencer's <cite>Theory
of Society</cite> contain a modest but very sufficient exposure
of the shortcomings of that popular philosopher's <i lang="la">a
priori</i> reasoning in politics.</p>

<p>With these serious pursuits there was mingled a
great deal of pleasant recreation. Holidays were spent
in adventurous walking and climbing in the Tyrol, in
Switzerland, and among the rolling fir-clad hills of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Black Forest, for Maitland as a young man was a swift
and enduring walker, with the true mountaineer's contempt
for high roads and level places. We hear of
boating expeditions on the Thames, of visits to
burlesques and pantomimes, of amusing legal squibs
and parodies poured out to order without any appearance
of effort. From childhood upwards music had
played a large part in Maitland's life and now that the
shadow of the Tripos was removed he was able to
gratify his musical taste to the full. In 1873 he spent
some time alone in Munich, listening to opera night
after night and then travelled to Bonn that he might
join his sisters at the Schumann Commemoration.
Those were the days when the star of Richard Wagner
was fast rising above the horizon and though he was
not prepared to burn all his incense at one shrine,
Maitland was a good Wagnerian. In London
musical taste was experiencing a revival, the origin of
which dated back, perhaps, to the starting of the
Saturday Concerts at the Crystal Palace by August
Manns in 1855. The musical world made pilgrimages
to the Crystal Palace to listen to the orchestral compositions
of Schubert and Schumann or to the St James'
Hall popular concerts, founded in 1859, to enjoy the
best chamber music of the greatest composers. New
developments followed, the first series of the Richter
Concerts in 1876 and the first performance of Wagner's
<cite>Ring</cite> in 1882. Maitland with his friend Cyprian
Williams regularly attended concert and opera. Without
claiming to be an expert he had a good knowledge
of music and a deep delight in it. One of his chief
Cambridge friends, Edmund Gurney, best known per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>haps
as one of the principal founders of the Society for
Psychical Research, wrote a valuable book on <cite>The
Power of Sound</cite> and interested Maitland in the
philosophy of their favourite art. "I walked once
with E. Gurney in the Tyrol," Maitland wrote long
afterwards, "What moods he had! On a good day it
was a joy to hear him laugh!" Gurney died prematurely
in 1888 and the increasing stress of work
came more and more between Maitland and the concert
room; but problems of sound continued to exercise a
certain fascination over his mind and his last paper contributed
to the Eranos Club at Cambridge on May 8,
1906, and entitled with characteristic directness "Do
Birds Sing?" was a speculation as to the conditions
under which articulate sound passes into music.</p>

<p>That by the natural workings of his enthusiastic
genius Maitland would have been drawn to history
whatever might have been the outward circumstances
of his career, is as certain as anything can be in the
realm of psychological conjecture. Men of the ordinary
fibre are confronted by alternatives which are all the
more real and painful by reason of their essential
indifference. This career is open to them or that
career, and they can adapt themselves with equal
comfort to either. But the man of genius follows his
star. His life acquires a unity of purpose which stands
out in contrast to the confused and blurred strivings of
lesser men. Other things he might do, other tastes he
might gratify; but there is one thing that he can do
supremely well, one taste which becomes a passion,
which swallows up all other impulses, and for which he
is prepared to sacrifice money and health and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
pleasures of society and many other things which are
prized among men.</p>

<p>When Maitland stood for the Trinity Fellowship
he was already aware that success at the bar would
mean the surrender of the reading which had "become
very dear" to him, and yet his ambition desired success
of one kind or another. The varied humours of his
profession pleased him; he loved the law and all its
ways; yet it is difficult to believe that the routine of a
prosperous equity business would ever have satisfied
so comprehensive and enquiring a mind. The young
barrister had a soul for something beyond drafts; he
lectured on political economy and political philosophy
in manufacturing towns and in London<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, wrote for the
<cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, then a liberal evening paper under
the direction of Mr John Morley; but more and more
he was drawn to feel the fascination and importance of
legal history. Two friends helped to determine his
course. Mr, now Sir Frederick, Pollock had preceded
Maitland by six years at Eton and Trinity and was
also a member of Lincoln's Inn. Coming of a famous
legal family, and himself already rising to distinction
as a scientific lawyer, Mr Pollock appreciated both the
value of English legal history and the neglect into
which it had been allowed to fall. He sought out
Maitland and a friendship was formed between the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>men which lasted in unbroken intimacy and frequent
intellectual communion to the end. An historical note
on the classification of the Forms of Personal Action,
contributed to his friend's book on the <em>Law of Torts</em>,
was the first overt evidence of the alliance.</p>

<p>The other friend was a Russian. Professor Paul
Vinogradoff, of Moscow, who had received his historical
education in Mommsen's Seminar in Berlin,
happened in 1884 to be paying a visit in England.
The Russian scholar, his superb instinct for history
fortified by the advantages of a system of training
such as no British University could offer, had, in
a brief visit to London, learnt something about the
resources of our Public Record Office which was
hidden from the Inns of Court and from the lecture
rooms of Oxford and Cambridge. On January 20,
Maitland and Vinogradoff chanced to meet upon one
of Leslie Stephen's Sunday tramps, concerning which
there will be some words hereafter, and at once discovered
a communion of tastes. The two men found
that they were working side by side and brushing one
another in their researches. Correspondence followed
of a learned kind; then on Sunday, May 11, there was
a decisive meeting at Oxford. The day was fine and
the two scholars strolled into the Parks, and lying full
length on the grass took up the thread of their historical
discourse. Maitland has spoken to me of that
Sunday talk; how from the lips of a foreigner he first
received a full consciousness of that matchless collection
of documents for the legal and social history of the
middle ages, which England had continuously preserved
and consistently neglected, of an unbroken stream of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
authentic testimony flowing for seven hundred years,
of tons of plea-rolls from which it would be possible to
restore an image of long-vanished life with a degree
of fidelity which could never be won from chronicles
and professed histories. His vivid mind was instantly
made up: on the following day he returned to London,
drove to the Record Office, and being a Gloucestershire
man and the inheritor of some pleasant acres in
that fruitful shire asked for the earliest plea-roll of the
County of Gloucester. He was supplied with a roll
for the year 1221, and without any formal training in
paleography proceeded to puzzle it out and to transcribe
it.</p>

<p>The <cite>Pleas of the Crown for the County of Gloucester</cite>
which appeared in 1884 with a dedication to
Paul Vinogradoff is a slim and outwardly insignificant
volume; but it marks an epoch in the history of
history. "What is here transcribed," observes the
editor, "is so much of the record of the Gloucestershire
eyre of 1221 as relates to pleas of the Crown.
Perhaps it may be welcome, not only to some students
of English law, but also (if such a distinction be maintainable)
to some students of English history. It is
a picture, or rather, since little imaginative art went
to its making, a photograph of English life as it was
early in the thirteenth century, and a photograph taken
from a point of view at which chroniclers too seldom
place themselves. What is there visible in the foreground
is crime, and crime of a vulgar kind&mdash;murder
and rape and robbery. This would be worth seeing
even were there no more to be seen, for crime is a
fact of which history must take note; but the political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
life of England is in a near background. We have
here, as it were, a section of the body politic which
shows just those most vital parts, of which, because
they were deep-seated, the soul politic was hardly
conscious, the system of local government and police,
the organization of county, hundred, and township."</p>

<p>It was the publication of a new and fundamental
type of authority accomplished with affectionate and
exquisite diligence by a scholar who had a keen eye
for the large issues as well as for the minutiæ of the
text. And it came at a timely moment. Sir James
Fitzjames Stephen's <cite>History of Criminal Law</cite> had
recently appeared and Maitland has written of it in
terms of genuine admiration; but remarkable as those
volumes undoubtedly were, miraculous even, if regard
be paid to the competing claims upon the author's
powers, they did not pretend to extend the boundaries
of medieval knowledge. The task of making discoveries
in the field of English legal antiquity, of
utilizing the material which had been brought to light
by the Record Commission appeared to have devolved
upon Germans and Americans. All the really important
books were foreign&mdash;Brunner's <cite>Schwurgerichte</cite>,
Bigelow's <cite>Placita Anglo-Normannica</cite> and <cite>History of
Procedure in England</cite>, the <cite>Harvard Essays on Anglo-Saxon
Law</cite>, Holmes' brilliant volume on the <cite>Common
Law</cite>. Of one great name indeed England could
boast. Sir Henry Maine's luminous and comprehensive
genius had drawn from the evidence of early
law a number of brilliant and fascinating conclusions
respecting the life and development of primitive
society, and had applied an intellectual impulse which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
made itself felt in every branch of serious historical
enquiry. But the very seductions of Maine's method,
the breadth of treatment, the all-prevailing atmosphere
of nimble speculation, the copious use of analogy and
comparison, the finish and elasticity of the style were
likely to lead to ambitious and ill-founded imitations.
It is so pleasant to build theories; so painful to discover
facts. Maitland was strong enough to resist
the temptation to premature theorizing about the
beginnings of human society. As an undergraduate
he had seen that simplicity had been the great enemy
of English Political Philosophy; and as a mature
student he came to discover how confused and indistinct
were the thoughts of our forefathers, and
how complex their social arrangements. What those
thoughts and arrangements were he determined to
discover, by exploring the sources published and
unpublished for English legal history. He knew
exactly what required to be done, and gallantly faced
long hours of unremunerative drudgery in the sure
and exultant faith that the end was worth the labour.
"Everything which he touched turned to gold." He
took up task after task, never resting, never hasting,
and each task was done in the right way and in the
right order. The study of English legal history was
revolutionised by his toil.</p>

<p>Before the fateful meeting with Vinogradoff at
Oxford, Maitland had made friends with Leslie
Stephen. In 1880 he joined "the goodly company,
fellowship or brotherhood of the Sunday tramps,"
which had been founded in the previous year by
Stephen, George Crome Robertson, the Editor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<cite>Mind</cite>, and Frederick Pollock. "The original members
of the Society about ten in number were for the
most part addicted to philosophy, but there was no
examination, test, oath or subscription, and in course
of time most professions and most interests were
represented." The rule of the Club was "to walk
every other Sunday for about eight months in the
year," and so long as Maitland lived in London he
was a faithful member of that strenuous company. A
certain wet Sunday lived in his memory and, though
he did not know it, lived also in the memory of Leslie
Stephen. "I was the only tramp who had obeyed the
writ of summons, which took the form of a postcard.
When the guide (we had no 'president,' certainly no
chairman, only so to speak, a 'preambulator') and his
one follower arrived at Harrow station, the weather
was so bad that there was nothing for it but to walk
back to London in drenching rain; but that day, faithful
alone among the faithless found, I learnt something
of Stephen, and now I bless the downpour which kept
less virtuous men indoors." That wet Sunday made
Maitland a welcome guest at the Stephen's house;
and it brought other happiness in its train. In 1886
Maitland was married in the village church of Brockenhurst,
Hants, to Florence Henrietta, eldest daughter
of Mr Herbert Fisher, some time Vice Warden of the
Stannaries, and niece of Mrs Leslie Stephen. Two
daughters, the elder born in 1887, and the younger
in 1889, were the offspring of the marriage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maitland had been recalled from
London to his old University. The reading which
had been "very dear to him" when he took the first
plunge into London work, had become dearer in proportion
as the opportunities for indulging in it became
more restricted. He was earning an income at the
bar which, though not large, was adequate to his needs,
but a barrister's income is uncertain and Maitland may
have felt that while he had no assured prospect of
improving his position at the bar, the life of a successful
barrister, if ever success were to come to him, would
entail an intellectual sacrifice which he was not prepared
to face. Accordingly in 1883 he offered himself for
a Readership in English Law in the University of
Oxford, but without success. A distinguished Oxford
man happened to be in the field and the choice of
the electors fell, not unnaturally, upon the home-bred
scholar. But meanwhile a movement was on foot in
the University of Cambridge to found a Readership
in English Law. In a Report upon the needs of the
University issued in June, 1883, the General Board of
Studies had included in an appendix a statement from
the Board of Legal Studies urging that two additional
teachers in English Law should be established as
assistants to the Downing Professor. Nothing however
was done and the execution of the project might
have been indefinitely postponed but for the generosity
of Professor Henry Sidgwick, who offered to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
£300 a year from his own stipend for four years if a
Readership could be established. Sidgwick's action
was clearly dictated by a general view of the educational
needs of the University, but he had never lost
sight of his old pupil and no doubt realised that
Maitland was available and that he was not unlikely
to be elected. The Senate accepted the generous
offer, the Readership was established, and on November
24, 1884, Maitland was elected to be Reader of
English Law in the University of Cambridge. In the
Lent term of 1885 he gave his first course of lectures
on the English Law of Contracts.</p>

<p>Cambridge offered opportunities for study such as
Maitland had not yet enjoyed. A little volume on
Justice and Police, contributed to the English Citizen
series and designed to interest the general reading
public, came out in 1885, and affords good evidence
of Maitland's firm grasp of the Statute book and of
his easy command of historical perspective. But this
book, excellent as it is, did not represent the deeper
and more original side of Maitland's activity any more
than an admirable series of lectures upon Constitutional
History which were greatly appreciated by undergraduate
audiences but never published in his lifetime.
The Reader in English Law was by no means satisfied
with providing excellent lectures covering the whole
field of English Constitutional history, though he had
much that was fresh and true to say about the Statutes
of the eighteenth century and about the degree to
which the theories of Blackstone were applicable to
modern conditions, and though he drew a picture for
his undergraduate audience which in some important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
respects was closer to fact than Walter Bagehot's
famous sketch of the English Constitution published
while Maitland was an Eton boy. Text
book and Lectures were but interludes in the
main operations of the campaign against the unconquered
fastnesses of medieval law. First came a
remarkable series of articles contributed to the <cite>Law
Quarterly Review</cite> upon the medieval doctrine of
seisin which Maitland's sure insight had discerned
to be the central feature in the land law of the
Norman and Angevin period: and then in 1887
Bracton's Note Book.</p>

<p>"Twice in the history of England has an Englishman
had the motive, the courage, the power to write
a great readable reasonable book about English Law
as a whole." The task which William Blackstone
achieved in the middle of the eighteenth century,
Henry de Bratton, a judge of the King's Court,
accomplished in the reign of Henry III. His
elaborate but uncompleted treatise <cite>De Legibus et
Consuetudinibus Angliæ</cite>, composed in the period
which lies between the legal reforms of Henry II.
and the great outburst of Edwardian legislation, while
the Common law of England was still plastic and
baronage and people were claiming from the King
a stricter observance of the great Charter, is naturally
the most important single authority for our medieval
legal history. Though influenced by the categories
and scientific spirit of Roman Law, Henry de Bratton
was essentially English, essentially practical. His
book was based upon the case law of his own age&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><i lang="la">Et
sciendum est quod materia est facta et casus qui
quotidie emergunt et eveniunt in regno Angliæ</i>&mdash;and
especially upon the plea-rolls of two contemporary
judges, Walter Raleigh and William Pateshull. An
edition in six volumes executed for the Rolls Series
by Sir Travers Twiss had been completed in 1883,
the year before Maitland paid his first visit to the
Record Office and discovered the plea-rolls of the
County of Gloucester; but the text was faulty and far
from creditable to English scholarship.</p>

<p>On July 19, 1884, Professor Vinogradoff, "who in
a few weeks" wrote Maitland, "learned, as it seems
to me, more about Bracton's text than any Englishman
has known since Selden died," published a letter in
the <cite>Athenæum</cite> drawing attention to a manuscript in
the British Museum, which contained "a careful and
copious collection of cases" for the first twenty-four
years of Henry III., a collection valuable in any case,
since many of the rolls from which it was copied have
long since been lost, but deriving an additional and
peculiar importance from the probability that it was
compiled for Bracton's use, annotated by his own
hand and employed as the groundwork of his treatise.
Yet, even if the connection with Bracton could not be
established, a manuscript containing no fewer than two
thousand cases from the period between 1217 and
1240 was too precious a discovery to be neglected.
Here was a mass of first-hand material, valuable alike
for the genealogist, the lawyer, the student of social
history:&mdash;glimpses of archaic usage, of local custom,
evidence of the spread of primogeniture, important
decisions affecting the status of the free man who held
villein lands, records of villein service, vivid little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
fragments of family story, some of it tragic, some of
it squalid, as well as passages of general historical
interest, entries concerning "the partition and therefore
the destruction of the Palatinate of Chester" or the
reversal of the outlawing of Hubert de Burgh the
great justiciar who at one time "held the kingdom of
England in his hand."</p>

<p>The Note Book was edited by Maitland in three
substantial volumes and with the lavish care of an
enthusiast. An elaborate argument, all the more
cogent because it is not overstrained, raised Vinogradoff's
hypothesis to the level of practical certainty.
"The treatise is absolutely unique; the Note Book so
far as we know is unique; these two unique books
seem to have been put together within a very few
years of each other, while yet the Statute of Merton
was <i lang="la">nova gracia</i>; Bracton's choice of authorities is
peculiar, distinctive; the compiler of the Note Book
made a very similar choice; he had, for instance, just
six consecutive rolls of pleas <i lang="la">coram rege</i>; Bracton had
just the same six; two-fifths of Bracton's five hundred
cases are in this book; every tenth case in this book
is cited by Bracton; some of Bracton's most out of the
way arguments are found in the margin of this book ... the
same phrases appear in the same contexts....
Corbyn's case, Ralph Arundell's case are 'noted up'
in the Note Book; they are 'noted up' also in the
Digby MS of the treatise; with hardly an exception
all the cases thus 'noted up' seem plainly to belong
to Bracton's county.... Lastly we find a strangely
intimate agreement in error; the history of the ordinance
about special bastardy and the 'Nolumus' of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Merton is confused and perverted in the two books.
Must we not say then that, until evidence be produced
on the other side, Bracton is entitled to a judgment,
a possessory judgment?" The penultimate argument
in the pleading was characteristic of Maitland's ingenuity
and also of a favourite pastime. He describes
an imaginary walking tour through Devon and
Cornwall and points out that ten cases noted up in
the margin of the Note Book refer to persons and
places which must have been well known to Bracton.
"Many questions are solved by walking. <i lang="la">Beati omnes
qui ambulant.</i>"</p>

<p>The appearance of the Note Book showed that
Cambridge possessed a scholar who could edit a big
medieval text with as sure a touch as Stubbs, and the
book received a warm welcome from those who were
entitled to judge of its merits. It had been a costly
book to prepare and it was brought out at Maitland's
own charges. In the introduction he took occasion to
point out that in other countries important national
records were apt to be published by national enterprise;
and that in England the wealth of unpublished
records was exceptional. "We have been embarrassed
by our riches, our untold riches. The nation put its
hand to the work and turned back faint-hearted.
Foreigners print their records; we, it must be supposed,
have too many records to be worth printing; so
there they lie, these invaluable materials for the history
of the English people, unread, unknown, almost untouched
save by the makers of pedigrees." As an
advertisement of these unknown treasures no more
fortunate selection could have been made than this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
manuscript note book which could with so high a
degree of probability be associated with the famous
name of Bracton. But Maitland was not content with
urging that the publication of our unknown legal
records should not be left to depend upon the chance
enthusiasm of isolated scholars; he demanded, as
things necessary to the progress of his subject, a sound
text of Bracton's treatise and a history of English Law
from the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>In 1888 there was by reason of the death of
Dr Birkbeck a vacancy in the Downing Chair of the
Laws of England. Maitland stood and was elected.
His Inaugural Lecture delivered in the Arts School
on 13th October, 1888, was entitled, "Why the History
of Law is not written." The reason was not a lack of
material; on the contrary England possessed a series
of records which "for continuity, catholicity, minute
detail and authoritative value has&mdash;I believe that we
may safely say it&mdash;no equal, no rival in the world," nor
yet the difficulty of treating the material, for owing
to the early centralization of justice, English history
possessed a wonderful unity. Rather it was "the
traditional isolation of English Law from every other
study" and the fact that practising lawyers are required
to know a little medieval law not as it was in the
middle ages, but as interpreted by modern courts to
suit modern facts. "A mixture of legal dogma and
legal history is in general an unsatisfactory compound.
I do not say that there are not judgments and text
books which have achieved the difficult task of combining
the results of deep historical research with
luminous and accurate exposition of existing law&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>neither
confounding the dogma nor perverting the
history; but the task is difficult. The lawyer must be
orthodox otherwise he is no lawyer; an orthodox
history seems to me a contradiction in terms. If this
truth is hidden from us by current phrases about
'historical methods of legal study,' that is another
reason why the history of our law is unwritten. If we
try to make history the handmaid of dogma she will
soon cease to be history."</p>

<p>Maitland concluded with an appeal for workers in
an untilled field, but with characteristic veracity held
out no illusory hopes. "Perhaps," he wrote, "our
imaginary student is not he that should come, not the
great man for the great book. To be frank with him
this is probable; great historians are at least as rare as
great lawyers. But short of the very greatest work,
there is good work to be done of many sorts and kinds,
large provinces to be reclaimed from the waste, to be
settled and cultivated for the use of man. Let him at
least know that within a quarter of a mile of the
chambers in which he sits lies the most glorious store
of material for legal history that has ever been collected
in one place and it is free to all like the air and the
sunlight. At least he can copy, at least he can arrange,
digest, make serviceable. Not a very splendid occupation
and we cannot promise him much money or
much fame.... He may find his reward in the work
itself: one cannot promise him even that; but the
work ought to be done and the great man when he
comes may fling a footnote of gratitude to those who
have smoothed his way, who have saved his eyes and
his time."</p>

<p>Now it may occur to you that in their anxiety to
avoid a confusion of the persons our courts fall into the opposite
of error and divide the substance. But that is not so. The
old things still exist and are owned, though new things 'transferable
in the books of the company' have come into being. Also it
seems possible that we may easily over-estimate the creative
powers of lawyers and courts and legislators. Let us
remember that these new things will be things for the man

let us ask ourselves whether if these 'things' are not unreal,

<p>As yet Maitland had not conceived himself as the
author of that "History of English Law from the
thirteenth century," the need for which he proclaimed
to his Cambridge audience. A less extensive scheme
had framed itself in his mind "some thoughts about a
plan of campaign for the History of the Manor." The
thoughts were communicated to Frederick Pollock and
were not unfruitful, for they grew up seven years later
into that massive <cite>History of English Law</cite> which is
perhaps Maitland's most enduring title to fame; but of
his learned projects in this seed-time and of some
other concerns, grave and gay, a few scraps of correspondence
may here most fittingly be adduced in
evidence.</p>

<p>I am indeed glad that you are working at Bracton
and settling the relation between the MSS. I wish
that you would stay here and teach us something
about our old books. Pollock is looking forward to
your paper and I am diligently reading Bracton in

Pollock a paper about seisin and had occasion to deal

I therefore looked at some of the MSS and found that

on "Torts"&mdash;I am already deep in it and am reading
it with delight. You will believe that coming from
me this is not an empty phrase, for you will do me

<p>"Cuius linguam ignorabant"&mdash;I feel now the full
force of these words&mdash;I am in tenebris exterioribus,
and there is stridor dencium; but I heartily congratulate
you upon having finished your book<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, and thank
you warmly for the copy of it that you sent me and
for the kind words that you wrote upon the outside.
Also I can just make out my name in the Preface and
am very proud to see it there. Also I have read the
footnotes and they are enough to show me that this is
a great book, destined in course of time to turn the
current of English and German learning.</p>

<p>My book also is finished, but the printers are slow.
I hope to send you a copy in the autumn. I have
been able to add a few links to the chain of argument
that you forged. My happiest discovery was about
a note that you may remember, "Ermeiard et herede
de Hokesham." I found (1) that the heir of Huxham
was in ward to William of Punchardon, (2) that
William's wife was Ermengard, (3) that Ermengard
brought an action for her dower against Henry of
Bratton. I have also had some success with Whitchurch,
Gorges, Corner and Winscot.</p>

<p>Horrabridge seems to be as much our post town
as any other place; but I have not fully fathomed our
postal relations. The legend is that the old gentleman
who squatted here&mdash;and if ever I saw an untitled
squatment I see one now&mdash;held that the post was "a
new found holiday" and charged the postman never
to come near him&mdash;and the postman, holding this to
be an acquittance for all time, refused and still refuses
to visit Pu Tor, but leaves our letters somewhere, I
know not where, whence they are fetched by Samuel
the son of the house&mdash;which Samuel learned the first
half of the alphabet in the school "to" Sumpford
Spiney Church-town when as yet there was a school,
but the school scattered and beyond N Samuel does
not go&mdash;howbeit, there will be a school again some
day if ever Mr Collier can catch A. J. Butler at the
Education Office, which is hardly to be expected.
But if I begin to tell the acts of the Putorians, I shall
never cease, for they are a race with a history and a
language and (it may be) a religion of their own.
Villani de Tawystock fecerunt cariagium&mdash;but the
ignorant beggars did not know Pu Tor cottage and it
seemed that we should wander about all night. This
is a right good spot and we are grateful to you for
discovering it. We have a sitting-room and two bedrooms
and we could find place for a visitor if his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
stomach were not high. Have you seen the new
ordnance map of the moor? Mr Collier showed it
me. <em>Pew</em> Tor is the spelling that it adopts.</p>

<p>I have returned from a brief incursion of Devonshire.
Verrall and I made a descent upon Lynton
which is still beautiful and at this time of the year un-betouristed.
Bank Holiday was tolerable. I suppose
that you spent it upon your freehold and are now
returning to the law. You have got an excellent
number of the <cite>L. Q. R.</cite><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> this quarter; really it ought

<p>If P objects to "ville" as a termination for names
in America what does he say to "wick" as a termination
for names in England? I have been puzzling
over the use of "villa" in Kemble's <cite>Codex</cite>. It seems
to be used now for a village or township and now for
a single messuage, and thus seems similarly elastic.
One never can be quite certain what is meant when
a villa is conveyed.</p>

<p>I have had some thoughts about a plan of campaign
for the history of the manor. The graver question is
whether the story should be told forwards or backwards.
I am not at all certain whether it would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
be well to begin by describing the situation as it was
at the end of cent. XIII. and then to go back to earlier
times. But we can talk of this when "possession" is
off your mind. Remember that you have to stay here
as an examiner. Meanwhile I hope to form a provisional
scheme for your consideration.</p>

<p>I have got hold of a German, one Inama Sternegg,
who seems to be the modern authority as to the growth
of the manorial system on the continent.</p>

I have been going over and over again in my mind
many parts of the pleasant talk that we had at
Cambridge during two of the most delightful days of
my life. I hope that you were not weary of instructing
me. Let me say that the more I think of your
theory of folk land the better I like it. Of course it
is a theory that must be tested and I know that you
will test it thoroughly: but it seems to me a true
inspiration, capable of explaining so very much, and
I think that it will be for English readers one of the
most striking things in your book. Should you care
for notes on any of the following matters I can send
them to you out of my Selden materials&mdash;(1) persons
with surname of "le Freman" paying merchet, (2) free
men refuse to serve on manorial jury, (3) the lord makes

<p>Your letter from Downing tells me what I expected,
namely, that the struggle was severe. I can very well
understand that there was much to be said against me&mdash;some
part of it at all events I have said to myself
day by day for the last month. My own belief to the
last moment was that some Q.C. who was losing health
or practice would ask for the place and get it. As it is,
I am reflecting that in spite of all complaints the bar
at large must still be doing a pretty profitable trade,
otherwise this post would not have gone begging.</p>

<p>Has this occurred to you?&mdash;how extremely different
the whole fate of English land law would have been if
the King's court had not opened its doors to the under-vassals,
to the lowest freeholders. But this was a
startling interference with feudal justice and only compassed
by degrees, in particular by remedies which in
theory were but possessory etc. Now if the lower
freehold tenants had not had the assizes, the line
between them and the villein tenants would have been
far less sharp. You hint at all this in chap. IV but
might it not be worth a few more words&mdash;for there
will be a tendency among your readers to say <em>of course</em>
freeholders had remedies in the King's courts while
really there is no of course in the matter. The point
that I should like emphasized&mdash;but perhaps you are
coming to this&mdash;is that not having remedies in the
King's own court is not equivalent to not having
rights.</p>

<p>I have been reading your proof sheets<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> with great
interest, and really as regards the parts which most
concern me I have little to suggest. I think the
chapter on law and morality particularly good. Were
I writing the book I should in my present state of
ignorance "hedge" a little about continental notions
of law. Since I had some talk with you I have been
reading several German law books, and my view of
the duties of a German judge is all the more hazy.
I find that a jurist, even when he is writing about
elementary legal ideas, e.g. possession, will cite
"Entscheidungen der oberste Gerichte von Celle,
Darmstadt, Rostock etc.," <em>if he thinks them sound</em>&mdash;but
how far he would think himself bound as judge by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>decisions which made against his theory I cannot
tell. All seems rendered so vague by the notion of
a heutige römische Recht. But I think that you have
just hit off the English idea of a good judge&mdash;he does
<em>justice</em> when he sees an opportunity of doing it. I do
not think that a man could be a judge of quite the
highest order without a strong feeling for political
morality. On p. <a href="#Page_92">92</a>, chap. XII. you might add if you
could do so that our highest courts of appeal, House
of Lords and Judicial Committee, hold themselves
bound by their own decisions in earlier cases.</p>

<p>As regards the existence of different laws in
different parts of a country you might reckon among
the advantages the gain in experience. I have no
doubt that Scotch experience has improved English
law and English experience Scotch law. Thus some
use of an experimental method is made possible; e.g.
take "Sunday closing" we can experiment on Wales
and Cornwall. On the whole I have been surprised
to find how little harm is done by the difference
between Scotch and English law. I have read but
very few cases that were caused by such differences.</p>

<p>I admire the chapter on International Law and
Morality; it is the best thing that I have read about
the subject. In my view the great difficulty in obtaining
a body of international rules deserving the name
of law lies in the extreme fewness of the "persons"
subject to that law and the infrequency and restricted
range of the arguable questions which arise between
them. The "code" of actually observed rules is thus
all shreds and patches. In short, international law is
so incoherent.</p>

<p>You ask me about the Preface<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;well I think it
grand work, and on the whole I think it will attract
readers because of its very strangeness; but you will
let me say that it will seem strange to English readers,
this attempt to connect the development of historical
study with the course of politics; and it leads you into
what will be thought paradoxes; e.g. it so happens
that our leading "village communists" Stubbs and
Maine are men of the most conservative type while
Seebohm who is to mark conservative reaction is a
thorough liberal. I am not speaking of votes at the
polling booth but of radical and essential habits of
mind. I think that you hardly allow enough for a
queer twist of the English mind which would make
me guess that the English believer in "free village
communities" would very probably be a conservative&mdash;I
don't mean a Tory or an aristocrat, but a conservative.
On the other hand with us the man who has the
most splendid hopes for the masses is very likely to
see in the past nothing but the domination of the
classes&mdash;of course this is no universal truth&mdash;but it
comes in as a disturbing element.</p>

<p>Your long letter was very welcome. When I wrote
I must have been in a bad temper and after I had
written I wished to recall my letter. But now I no
longer regret what has brought from you so pleasant
an answer. Really I have no fear at all about the
success of your book, if I had I would expatriate
myself. But it stands thus:&mdash;Introductions are of
"critical importance," by which I mean that they are
of importance to critics, being often the only parts of
a book which casual reviewers care to read. As a
matter of prudence therefore I put into an Introduction
a passage about the book which I mean critics to copy,
and they catch the bait&mdash;it saves them trouble and
mistakes. But your "philosophy of history," I mean
philosophy of historiography, will not lend itself to
such ready treatment and may give occasion to remarks
as obvious and as foolish as mine were. But I hope
for better things. All that you say about Stubbs and
Seebohm and Maine is, I dare say, very true if you
regard them as European, not merely English, phenomena
and attribute to them a widespread significance&mdash;and
doubtless it is very well that Englishmen should
see this&mdash;still looking at England only and our insular
ways of thinking I see Stubbs and Maine as two
pillars of conservatism, while as to Seebohm I think
that his book is as utterly devoid of political importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
as, shall I say Madox's <cite>History of the Exchequer</cite>?
But you are cosmopolitan and I doubt not that you are
right. You are putting things in a new light&mdash;that is
all&mdash;if "the darkness comprehendeth it not," that is
the darkness's fault.</p>

<p>And now as to Essay I. I have nothing to withdraw
or to qualify. I think it superb, by far the
greatest thing done for English legal history. I am
looking forward with the utmost anxiety to Essay II.</p>

when I paste into you the piece of paper that you sent
me. I have felt it a great honour to correct your
proof sheet and am almost as curious about what the
critics will say as if the book were my own. I often
think what an extraordinary piece of luck for me it was
that you and I met upon a "Sunday tramp." That
day determined the rest of my life. And now the
Council of the University has offered me the honour
of doctor "honoris causa." I was stunned by the offer
for it is an unusual one and of course I must accept it.
But for that Sunday tramp this would not have been.
As to the reception of your book my own impression
is that it will be very well received. Good criticism
you can hardly expect, for very few people here will be
able to judge of your work. But I think that you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
be loudly praised. Perhaps you will become an idol
like Maine&mdash;who can tell? I hardly wish you this

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV.</a></h2>


<p>The year which brought Maitland to Downing
witnessed the appearance of a new volume from his
pen entitled <cite>Select Pleas of the Crown 1200-1255</cite>. It
was a handsome quarto, bound in dark blue cloth, and
the first publication of a Society called after the name
of John Selden. The Selden Society, planned in the
autumn of 1886 and founded in the following year "to
encourage the study and advance the knowledge of
English law," was the creature of Maitland's enthusiasm,
and of all his achievements stood nearest to his
heart. Indeed, without disparagement to accomplished
help-mates and contributors, it may be said that without
Maitland's genius, learning and devotion the Selden
Society would have been unthinkable. Eight of the
twenty-one volumes issued by the Society during his
lifetime came from his pen; a ninth was almost completed
at his death. "Of the rest every sheet passed
under his supervision either in manuscript or in proof,
and often in both<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>." He set the standard, planned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>programme, trained many of the contributors. It is
difficult to recall an instance in the annals of English
scholarship in which so large an undertaking has
owed so much to the diligence and genius of a single
man.</p>

<p>Both in conception and execution it is a noble
series of volumes. Maitland's interest in law was not
bounded by a province, a period, or a country; and
the thirteen good and lawful men who on November 24,
1886, signed the letter from which the Selden Society
sprang did not make their appeal to the Bar and
Bench of England in the cause of any narrow or
pedantic antiquarian curiosity. The Common law of
England ruled two vast continents, and was the concern
of Americans, Canadians, and Australians as well as of
Englishmen and Irishmen. Its history had never
been written; few of the materials for its exploration
had been given to the world. There was no scientific
grammar or glossary of the Anglo-French language;
there was no accurate dictionary of law terms; a great
province, that of Anglo-Saxon law, had fallen into the
occupation of the Germans. A short account of some
of the principal classes of Records which might be
dealt with by the Society was appended to the first
two volumes and exhibited a prospect of great breadth,
richness and variety. The state of the Criminal law
in early times might be shown from the Eyre rolls and
Assize rolls. The records of the Court of the Exchequer
and the Court of Chancery, the Privy Council
Registers, the proceedings before the Star chamber, the
Court of Requests and the Court of Augmentations
would illustrate the history of royal justice in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
different sides and in different ages, in the formative
period of legal and parliamentary growth, in the dreary
turmoil of Lancastrian anarchy, under the vigorous
despotism of the Tudors and in the dust of the great
conflict which led to the Civil War. Then there were
the records of the Courts Christian, of the Courts of
the Forest and the Manor, records illustrating the
history of the Palatine jurisdictions, the franchises of
the Lords Marchers of Wales, the Court of the Staple
in London and Calais, the Court of Castle Chamber in
Dublin. Borough customs would throw light on one
quarter of history; records of the Stanneries of Devon
and Cornwall upon another. The origins of mercantile
and international law might be explored; and closer
knowledge could be obtained of many important State
trials by a systematic account of the contents of the
<cite>Baga de Secretis</cite>. The Society held out the further
hope of scientific contributions to the knowledge of
the Anglo-Saxon law and Anglo-French language of
the Year Books.</p>

<p>In the selection of specimens from this copious
material, Maitland displayed a felicitous strategy the
aim of which was to exhibit, as rapidly as might be,
the range and versatility of the Society's operations.
A sequence of volumes illustrating any one department
of law would fatigue attention, warn off subscribers
and fail to make the desired impression on the
general historical public. It was better to begin upon
several different types of record than to work one vein
without intermission; better for the cause of science,
and a course more likely to bring forward good contributors
as well as to stimulate public interest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
undertaking. With a general editor less perfectly
equipped such a scheme might have been hazardous;
but Maitland was master of the whole field and could
be trusted not to fail in proportion and perspective.
In swift succession the members of the Selden Society
received volumes illustrating Pleas of the Crown, Pleas
of Manorial Courts, Civil Pleas, manorial formularies,
the Leet jurisdiction of Norwich, Admiralty Pleas;
then an edition of the <cite>Mirror of Justice</cite> followed by a
volume on <cite>Bracton and Azo</cite>. Of these first eight
volumes Maitland wrote four and contributed a brilliant
introduction to a fifth&mdash;the edition of the <cite>Mirror</cite>,
executed by his pupil and friend Mr W. J. Whittaker.
It was an astonishing performance; even had the work
been spread over twelve years of robust energy it
would still have been astonishing. It was accomplished
in half that time by a busy, delicate, University Professor
who apart from statutory Professorial lectures
was simultaneously engaged in writing the classical
<cite>History of English Law</cite>.</p>

<p>Much might be said by qualified persons as to the
exquisite technique displayed in Maitland's contributions
to the Selden Society. He spared no pains in
the examination and collation of manuscripts, and
although he modestly disdained expert paleographical
knowledge, he need not, we imagine, fear comparison
with the most accurate transcribers of medieval documents,
or with those who have achieved a special
renown for their studies in "diplomatic" or in the
affiliation of manuscripts. He possessed other qualities
which are not often combined with such a passion and
gift for minute scholarship. In the first place he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
exceedingly anxious to make his work practically useful
and to ease the path for students whose tastes might
lead them to attempt similar explorations. He takes
the reader into his laboratory and exhibits the whole
process of discovery, showing where the difficulties lie,
pointing out hopeful lines of enquiry, and providing
always a clear chart to the documents, published and
unpublished, of his subject. Secondly he combined in
an extraordinary measure the gift for hypothesis with
the quality of patience. He did not aim at providing
sensational or curious results;&mdash;"the editor," he writes
in the introduction to the first Selden volume, "has
not conceived it his duty to hunt for curiosities, the
history of law is not a history of curiosities"&mdash;he wished
for plain truth&mdash;to discover the course of medieval
justice in all its natural and instructive monotony, in
its common forms and in its everyday working garb.
"It has been necessary," he writes, referring to his
selection of manorial pleas, "to print some matter
which in itself is dull and monotonous; a book full
of curiosities would be a very unfair representative
of what went on in the local courts. We cannot
form a true notion of them unless we know how they
did their ordinary work, and this we cannot know until
we have mastered their common forms." Such a
scheme no doubt involves repetition, but there is at
least one student of English history who, despite some
acquaintance with histories and chronicles, never understood
the everyday working of medieval life until he
had the good fortune to dive into the publications of
the Selden Society.</p>

<p>A saying used to be attributed to E. A. Freeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to the effect that it is impossible to write history from
manuscripts; and it is obvious that a man who uses
manuscript authority to any great extent, especially if
he imposes upon himself great labours of transcription,
will run the risk of losing his perspective and will be
inclined to attach undue importance to those parts of
his evidence which have cost him most sacrifice to
obtain. On the other hand it is clear that the editor
of historical manuscripts will do his work much better
if he is also an historian; and this is specially true if
he is called upon to pick and choose out of a vast
repository of unedited material those specimens which
are most likely to promote the advance of scientific
knowledge. Maitland brought to the task of editing
legal records an exact and comprehensive knowledge
of the various problems, each in its proper order of
importance, towards the solution of which his material
might be expected to contribute. Like a skilful
advocate examining a string of reluctant witnesses
he had in his mind a provisional scheme of the
whole transaction to quicken and define his curiosity.
"These rolls," he writes, "are taciturn, they do not
easily yield up their testimony, but must be examined
and cross-examined." It was a close, seductive, patient
cross-examination, one in which a little matter would
often suggest an important conclusion, as where it is
shown that the rapid development of the Common
law in the thirteenth century is mirrored on the
surface of the plea-rolls, which become fuller, more
regular and more mechanical as the century goes on.
And this cross-examination being conducted with great
subtlety, vividness and penetration resulted in sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>stantial
discoveries. Each volume contributed new
thought as well as new facts. The preface to <cite>Select
Pleas of the Crown</cite> traced the gradual differentiation
of the several branches of the Royal Court in the early
part of the thirteenth century and embodied valuable
conclusions "drawn from a superficial perusal of all
the rolls of John's reign" as to the state of criminal
justice and criminal procedure at that epoch. The
Introduction to the <cite>Select Pleas of Manorial Courts</cite>
was even more important, giving as it did for the first
time an account of the stages in the decline of the
English private courts and supplying an analysis,
subtler than any which had yet been attempted, of
the legal connotation of the term "manerium" and of
the composition of the manorial courts. One suggestion
was startling in its originality. The orthodox
theory, contained in the works of Coke, had laid it
down that a Court Baron could not be held without at
least two freeholders. Maitland came upon the whole
to the conclusion&mdash;though he is careful to state countervailing
arguments&mdash;that originally no distinction was
made between the freeholders and customary tenants.
Both classes attended the Manorial Court and both
classes gave judgment. Distinctions, however, did
come to be drawn, and this by reason of a force
the operation of which had escaped the notice of
enquirers who had not been trained to attend to legal
phenomena&mdash;by the force of legal procedure. "New
modes of procedure are emphasising distinctions which
have heretofore been less felt. The freehold suitors
can maintain their position<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, the customary suitors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>become mere presenters and jurymen with the lord's
steward as their judge. Every extension of royal
justice at the expense of feudal does some immediate
harm to the villein. It is just because all other people
can sue for their lands and their goods in the King's
own Court that he seems so utterly defenceless against
the lord: 'the custom of the manor' looks so like
'the will of the lord' just because the humblest
freeholder has something much better than the custom
of the manor to rely upon, for he has the assizes of our
lord the King, the Statutes of King and Parliament."</p>

<p>The third volume edited by Maitland for the
Selden Society consisted of two parts&mdash;a collection
of Precedences for use in seignorial and other local
courts belonging to the thirteenth and early part of
the fourteenth century, and Select Pleas from the
Bishop of Ely's Court at Littleport. Here there was
less matter for elaborate historical disquisition, for the
main problem with regard to the first class of document
was to settle the age of the manuscripts; but the brief
introduction to the Littleport pleas contained an important
suggestion with regard to the early history of
the English law of Contract. Were not the local
courts enforcing "formless" arguments long before the
King's Court had developed the action of "assumpsit"
for the enforcement of agreements not under seal?
The reader is reminded that the King's Court never
by any formal act or declaration took upon itself to
enforce the whole law of the land, that only by degrees
did its "catalogue of the forms of action become the
one standard of English law." There was an action
for defamation in the local courts long before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Kings Court had undertaken to punish the slanderer;
and what was true of defamation might equally be true
of "parol" agreements. The Bishop's Court at Littleport
was certainly enforcing agreements and it was
difficult to suppose that the villeins of Littleport put
their contracts into writing. Here again a few slight
indications had prompted a secure and far-reaching
inference.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Institutes</cite> of the learned but uncritical Coke
there are many tales drawn from a curious Anglo-French
treatise entitled the <cite>Mirror of Justices</cite>, "a very
ancient and learned treatise of the laws and usages of
this kingdom," opined Sir Edward, "whereby the
Common-wealth of our nation was governed about
eleven hundred years past." For a long time the book
was accepted at Coke's high valuation with no little
injury to the sober study of legal antiquities. Then it
was exposed as apocryphal by Sir Francis Palgrave.
It could not be taken as evidence "concerning the early
jurisprudence of Anglo-Saxon England." But could
it be taken as evidence of anything at all? <cite>Wahrheit
und Dichtung</cite> was Vinogradoff's verdict,&mdash;sediments
of truth floating in a sea of absurdity. It was worth
while at least to establish the text and to examine
the credentials of a treatise which, like the pseudo-Ingulph,
had done much harm to sound learning.</p>

<p>One reassuring result was obtained from Mr
Whittaker's critical enquiry into the manuscript. The
<cite>Mirror</cite> was never in the middle ages a popular
or influential book. It existed in a single unique
manuscript. Such authority as it obtained was conferred
upon it by lawyers who lived some three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hundred years after it was written, were "greedy of
old tales and not too critical of the source from which
they were derived." Still, in a book so full of concrete
positive statement, so full of denunciation of practical
abuses, there might for all its rubble of absurdity be a
quarry for historians.</p>

<p>In a brilliant piece of persiflage Maitland once and
for all demolishes the author of the <cite>Mirror</cite>. He
exposes his wilful lies, his unctuous piety, the perverse
originality which amuses itself by playing havoc among
technical terms, his absence of all lawyerly interest,
his perplexing and fantastic inconsistencies. A most
ingenious hypothesis is advanced to explain the
source of this curious piece of apocryphal literature.
"In order to discover the date of its composition
we ask what statutes are, and what are not, noticed
in it, and we are thus led to the years between 1285
and 1290. Then we see that its main and ever-recurring
theme is a denunciation of 'false judges,' and we
call to mind the shameful events of 1289. The truth
was bad enough; no doubt it was made far worse by
suspicions and rumours. Wherever English men met
they were talking of 'false judges' and the punishment
that awaited them. All confidence in the official
oracles of the law had vanished. Any man's word
about the law might be believed if he spoke in the
tones of a prophet or apostle. Was not there an
opening here for a fanciful young man ambitious of
literary fame? Was not this an occasion for a squib,
a skit, a topical medley, a 'variety entertainment,'
blended of truth and falsehood, in which Bracton's
staid jurisprudence should be mingled with freaks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
crotchets and myths and marvels, and decorated with
queer tags of out-of-the-way learning picked up in the
consistories?" No doubt, as Maitland admitted, this
was guess-work; the certainty was that no statement
not elsewhere warranted could be accepted from the
<cite>Mirror</cite> unless we were prepared to believe "that an
Englishman called Nolling was indicted for a sacrifice
to Mahomet."</p>

<p>The Chair of the Laws of England carried with it
a Fellowship and an official house at Downing. The
College, standing apart from "the sights" of Cambridge
and possessing neither antiquarian nor architectural
interest, is probably neglected even by the most
conscientious of our foreign visitors. Yet during
Maitland's tenure of the Downing Chair distinguished
jurists from many distant parts, from America, Germany,
Austria, France, found their way "through the inconspicuous
gateway opening off the main business street"
into the spacious quadrangle, with its pleasant grove
of lime and elm, and its two rows of late Georgian
buildings fronting one another across the grass. One
of these guests has recorded his impressions. "About
the middle of the row on the western side Maitland
had his house. His study was a plain square room,
not entirely given up to law or history and not overcrowded
with folios. Yet every book on the shelves
had evidently been chosen; there was no useless
pedantic lumber. One gained at once an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of refined taste and sure critical judgment. The workshop
mirrored the worker. The view from the study
window was that of the open lawn and the monotonous
row of houses opposite. But on the western side the
house was set right into the thicket. Here every sort
of English songster seemed to have its nest<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>."</p>

<p>Maitland at least was well content. He loved
Cambridge, every stone of it, and prized its friendships.
There were Henry Sidgwick, his old master in
philosophy; and A. W. Verrall, an exact equal in University
standing, who had become intimate with him at
Trinity, had shared his chambers at Lincoln's Inn but
had abandoned the law for the Greek and Latin Classics;
there were C. S. Kenny, a friend of undergraduate days,
a Union orator and a criminal lawyer; and G. W.
Prothero, who bore most of the weight of the historical
teaching in the University; and Henry Jackson, who
long afterwards succeeded Jebb in the Chair of Greek;
and R. T. Wright, the Secretary to the University
Press. For Dr Alex Hill, the Master of Downing,
Maitland soon came to entertain feelings of affectionate
admiration. Nor was his power of making friends
limited to men of his own age. His directness of
manner, his simplicity and humour at once secured
him the confidence and respect of younger men, and
he rapidly made his name as one of the most inspiring
teachers in the University, giving to the student, in
Mr Whittaker's eloquent words, "a sense of the importance,
of the magnificence, of the splendour of the
study in which he was engaged, so that it was impossible
at any time thereafter for one of his pupils to regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the law merely as a means of livelihood<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>." His method
of lecturing, like everything else he did, was quite
individual. The lecture was carefully written and read
in a slow distinct impressive voice to the audience, so
slowly that it was possible to take very full notes, and
yet with such a rare intensity of feeling in every word
and intonation, with such quiet and unsuspected jets of
humour, such electric flashes of vision, that the hearers
were never weary, and one of them has reported
that Maitland made you feel that the history of law in
the twelfth century was the only thing in life worth
living for. Stories, too, have reached the sister University
of witty speeches made after dinner, as for
instance on November 11, 1897, when fourteen of Her
Majesty's judges were entertained in the Hall of
Downing upon the occasion of the Lord Chief Justice
receiving an honorary degree, and the speech of the
evening was made by the Professor of the Laws of
England. And there were other less august occasions.
The members of a distinguished and occult society
record a series of impromptu speculations as to the
character of the company assembled round the table.
Were they the Salvation Army? No, they were not
musical. Were they the Board of Works? Were
they the Saved of Faith?&mdash;and so on through a series
of hypotheses each more grotesque and fantastic than
the last and delivered in the clear grave tones which
made Maitland's humour irresistible.</p>

<p>Among the most welcome guests at Brookside in
the days of the Readership and at the West Lodge in
the early days of Maitland's tenure of the Downin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>g
Chair was J. K. Stephen, the brilliant author of <cite>Lapsus
Calami</cite>. J. K. Stephen, son of Sir James and nephew
of Leslie Stephen, most tender, witty, and vivacious of
companions, was on every account dear to Maitland
and his wife.</p>

<p>In January, 1888, Stephen launched a weekly
magazine called <cite>The Reflector</cite>. It was the year in
which Maitland exchanged Brookside for Downing,
the year of the first publication of the Selden Society,
and finally the year of Mr Ritchie's County Council
Act. Being invited to contribute a paper to the new
periodical Maitland chose as his theme the impending
revolution in English local government. The administrative
functions of the Justices of the Peace were to
be transferred to elective County Councils. In a
charming essay full of ripe wisdom and pleasant wit
Maitland bade farewell to the old order and expressed
some of the misgivings which the inevitable change
aroused in his mind. Master Shallow and Master
Silence were to be stripped of half their functions and
might come to the conclusion that the other half was
not worth preserving. That which was "perhaps the
most distinctively English part of all our institutions,"
the Commission of the Peace, was attacked in a vital
part, not because the Justices had been corrupt or extravagant,
but because the spirit of the age condemned
them. "The average Justice of the Peace is a far
more capable man than the average alderman, or the
average guardian of the poor; consequently he requires
much less official supervision. As a governor he is
doomed; but there has been no accusation. He is
cheap, he is pure, he is capable, but he is doomed; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
is to be sacrificed to a theory, on the altar of the spirit
of the age." Regrets, however, were vain. On the
contrary, since the control of the central Government
was already vested in the people, it was best that the
people should gain political experience in local affairs,
that the local authorities should be given a free hand
to manage and to mismanage, and that care should be
taken to invest them with such a degree of dignity and
independence as should attract the best men into the
public service. Maitland did not often express himself
on public affairs; but he watched them closely and
took no conclusions at second-hand.</p>

<p>It is part of our English system to expect of
our professors, however eminent they may be, that
they should examine undergraduates, serve on boards,
committees, syndicates, and take an active part
in University and College affairs. Maitland did not
seek to escape any duty which he might be expected
to discharge. He examined five times in the Law
Tripos, twice in the Historical Tripos and three times
in the Moral Science Tripos. From November, 1886,
to January, 1895, he served as secretary to the Law
Board, and always took an active share in its work.
He was a member of the Library Syndicate (helping
to redraft its regulations), he served on the General
Board of Studies, and in 1894 was elected to the
Council of the Senate. Nobody is so valuable on
a committee as a good draftsman and Maitland's quick
and exact draftsmanship caused his services to be
highly esteemed by any board or syndicate of which
he was a member. "He took," says Mr Wright,
"little part in the discussions of these bodies unless he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
had something definite to say, but was always ready to
state his views on being appealed to, and it is not
necessary to say that they always carried great weight."
The Dean of Westminster, who for some time sat next
to him at the Council meetings, was impressed by the
"sagacity and courage" of his judgments in the interpretation
of statutes. "'I always stretch a statute,' he
whispered to me once half humourously. He seemed
to be making the law grow under his hands<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>."</p>

<p>In the public debates of the Senate House he was
rarely heard, but when he spoke there was a sensation.
Academic oratory is generally above the average in
tone and ability, but is seldom spirited or passionate,
and often goes astray into subtleties and side issues.
In the judgment of some members of his audience,
Maitland's speaking was quite unlike any other oratory
which was heard in Cambridge. The whole man
seemed quick with fire. His animation was so intense
that it hardly seemed to belong to a northern temperament,
expressing itself with dramatic force in every
line of his eloquent face, in every movement of hand
and arm and in the rhythm of the body which swayed
with the spoken word. The language of his speeches,
which had been carefully thought out, was clear and
weighty, full of pungent humour and unexpected turns,
and stamped with the impress of a restrained but
vehement idealism. The speech on Women's Degrees
was a masterpiece after its kind and very little was
heard of a proposal to establish a separate University
for Women after Maitland had suggested that it should
be called the "Bletchley Junction Academy"&mdash;"for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
at Bletchley you change either for Oxford or for
Cambridge."</p>

<p>The oration against compulsory Greek, though less
cogent in substance, was hardly less striking in form.</p>

<p>College business claimed and received no small part
of the time which under the system of the continental
Universities would have been devoted to the advancement
of knowledge. "When," writes Dr Hill, "in
1888 Maitland was elected Downing Professor of the
Laws of England, the older members of the Society,
knowing his attachment to Trinity, doubted whether
he would feel himself naturalised in the smaller College.
From the moment of his admission all misgivings
vanished. With characteristic chivalry he assumed
and almost over-acted his new <em>rôle</em>. His eager
patriotism was a challenge to our own. He was
prepared to out-do Downing men in his labours in all
matters pertaining to the welfare of the College." If
a Statute was to be interpreted, if title deeds were to
be scheduled, if a voyage was to be made to the
Record office in search of "feet of fines," Maitland
was at hand willing and eager to interpret, to schedule,
to investigate. "In all questions of interpretation,"
Dr Hill continues, "Maitland was standing counsel
to the College as he was to the University." It so
happened that when he joined Downing rents were
rapidly falling and that the management of the estates
entailed much care and thought. College meetings
were very frequent and not a few of the special
difficulties which arose, involved legal proceedings.
Maitland, who for three years received no part of
his salary as fellow, put himself unreservedly at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
disposition of the College, and an academic society
struggling to extricate itself from financial embarrassments
could not have invoked a more valuable ally.
Now he would help to draft a memorial to the Master
of the Rolls; now a bill to be brought before
Parliament. "His legal training and knowledge and
his nicely balanced judgment were of inestimable use
in the solution of the special problems with which
the College had to deal." But it was not in legal
matters only that he gave service without stint. "He
was equally loyal in taking his share in all phases
of administration and in doing all that in him lay to
enrich the College life. He dined regularly in Hall
and spent the evening in the combination room to the
delight of his own guests and those introduced by
other members of the Society." The Master of
Downing might be painting the portrait of an ideal
Fellow; those who know the College best will be the
last to dispute its resemblance.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1892 Maitland advertised a
course of lectures upon "Some Principles of Equity,"
and from that date onward till 1906 a course upon
equity&mdash;"Equity more especially Trusts" was the
favourite title&mdash;figured in the yearly programme of
the Downing Professor. At first the subject was
packed into the Lent term; then the lectures grew
and overflowed into the summer. "I put in some
business," he would observe gaily, "the business"
consisting of recent decisions of the Chancery division,
for the lectures were revised year by year to keep
pace with the march of knowledge and the requirements
of the practical student. Of these discourses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
there is the less reason to speak, even if the present
writer were entitled to be heard, seeing that they have
now been given to the world, thanks to the labour
of two distinguished and devoted pupils. Maitland
explained to his audience the whole system of modern
equity, and when a lawyer is unfolding the Administration
of Assets or the doctrines of Conversion,
Election and Specific Performance to qualified persons,
the layman would do well to keep his peace. It is,
however, a quality in Maitland that much as he enjoyed
the technicalities of law, he was never content to be
purely technical. The same gifts which shone out in
his conversation, the genius for perspicuous and
graphic description, the quick darting flight to the
essential point, the fertile power of exhibiting a subject
in new and original aspects were conspicuous in his
handling of the least promising topics, and these lectures
could never have been written by a man who was
nothing more than a sound Chancery practitioner.
What is equity and what is its relation to the
common law? So simple and fundamental do these
questions appear to be that one would imagine that
the correct answer to them must have been given
again and again. It is one of those numerous cases
in which a truth which appears to be quite obvious as
soon as it is pointed out has lain if not unperceived, at
least imperfectly perceived, because the proper perspective
depends upon an unusual combination of
studies. Maitland, doubly equipped as an historian
and a lawyer, found no difficulty in demonstrating two
propositions which had never been clearly stated before,
first that "equity without common law would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
been a castle in the air and an impossibility," and
second "that we ought to think of the relation between
common law and equity not as that between two
conflicting systems but as that between code and
supplement, that between text and gloss." Such
observations will soon savour of platitude. That
equity was not a self-sufficient system, that it was
hardly a system at all but rather "a collection of
additional rules," that if the common law had been
abolished equity must have disappeared also, for it
presupposed a great body of common law, that normally
the relation between equity and law has not
been one of conflict, for the presence of two conflicting
systems of law would have been destructive of all good
government&mdash;such propositions only require to be
stated to meet with acceptance. Yet it was left to
Maitland to state them. The need for thus emphasising
the essential unity of English law was due partly
to the tendency of teachers to lay stress upon the cases
in which there is a variance between the rules of
common law and the rules of equity and partly to
the fact that in the routine of his profession the practitioner
would have his attention directed rather to
such occasions of variance than to the necessary and
intricate dependence of equity on common law. Perhaps
there is no greater proof of originality than the
discovery of truths, which have no surprising quality
about them except the length of time during which
they have gone unnoticed or obscured.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI.</a></h2>


<p>Among the operations which belong to that wonderful
period of activity which culminated in the <cite>History
of English Law</cite>, two remain to be singled out, the first
an enquiry of great delicacy and of crucial importance
for the history of legal procedure, the second lying
somewhat outside the ordinary sphere of Maitland's
investigations but of great moment to the student of
parliamentary institutions. We allude to the articles
upon the "Register of Original Writs" contributed to the
<cite>Harvard Law Review</cite> in 1889 and to the <cite>Memoranda
de Parliamento</cite> edited for the Rolls Series in 1893.</p>

<p>The Register of the wryttes orygynall and judiciall
was first printed by William Rastell in 1531. "In
its final form when it gets into print it is an organic
book.... To ask for its date would be like asking for
the date of one of our great cathedrals. In age after
age bishop after bishop has left his mark upon the
church; in age after age chancellor after chancellor
has left his mark upon the Register.... To ask for the
date of the Register is like asking for the date of
English law." Yet this vast and important repertory
had never been made the subject of critical examination.
No one had examined the principles upon which
the printed book was constructed; no one had gone
behind the printed book to the manuscripts; no one
had traced the life history of the organism, had fixed
the chronological sequence of the successive styles in
the cathedral. Yet until such critical work had been
accomplished the history of the extension of royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
justice and of the growth of English legal procedure
could not be written in detail. Maitland's treatment
of the problem is one of the most beautiful specimens
of his workmanship.</p>

<p>He first discovers the principles of classification in
the printed book; then turning to the manuscripts&mdash;and
there are at least nineteen in the Cambridge
University Library, over all of which he has cast his
eye,&mdash;reports that no two manuscripts are alike, but
that "gradually by comparing many manuscripts we
may be able to form some notion of the order in
which and the times at which the various writs
became recognised members of the <cite>Corpus Brevium</cite>."
Tests are then laid down by which the age of a
Register may be determined, and finally we have "a
few remarks about the early history of the Register"
which are entirely original and of high importance.
The two earliest manuscripts are examined, the MS
Register of 1227 in the British Museum with its fifty-six
writs, the MS Cambridge Register belonging
likewise to the early part of Henry III's reign with
its fifty-eight writs; and means are thus supplied for
measuring the growth of law during the important
period&mdash;the period of the Great Charter&mdash;which had
elapsed between Glanvill's treatise and the third
decade of the thirteenth century. Then we are guided
through the later and more voluminous manuscripts.
We are introduced to a Register with one hundred
and twenty-one writs from the middle of the thirteenth
century, to an Edwardian Register which contains four
hundred and seventy-one writs; we see the writ of
trespass taking a permanent place in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span><cite>Corpus
Brevium</cite> under Edward II, we trace activity under
Edward III and Richard II and then a slackening.
By the turn of the fourteenth century the "great
cathedral" is practically complete and the Register
has assumed a form not substantially different from
that which was printed in the reign of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Maitland's contribution to parliamentary history
consisted in the editing of the <cite>Parliament Roll</cite> for
1305. Of the vivid and picturesque interest of the
petitions printed in that volume much might be
written, for nowhere else can we gain so full and
comprehensive a notion of the miscellaneous transactions
and aspirations which came under the purview
of a Parliament in the very early stages of its existence.
But apart from this the volume is important
as furnishing a closer and more accurate view of the
evolution of parliament than had previously been
obtainable. All readers of Stubbs' <cite>Constitutional
History</cite> are familiar with "the model Parliament of
1295." We are accustomed to think of that date
as marking an epoch at which government by a
Parliament of Three Estates is definitely secured,
and as, in a certain sense, the close of the formative
period of parliamentary institutions. It is true that
Parliament is not yet divided into Lords and Commons,
and that procedure by Bill is in the distant future.
Still we have been wont to regard a Parliament as
being throughout the fourteenth century a definite
well-recognised institution, distinct from the King's
Council and implying the presence of representatives
from shire and borough. Maitland's preface to the
<cite>Memoranda de Parliamento</cite> showed that such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
impression should be modified. Ten years after the
Model Parliament practice and nomenclature were
still fluid. There was no distinction between Parliament
and Council; the word <i lang="la">Parliamentum</i> is never
found in the nominative; any solemn session of the
Kings Council might be termed a Parliament. The
business too, transacted at these great inquests, was
for the most part administrative and judicial, conducted
through the examination and endorsement of
petitions. At the beginning of the fourteenth century,
despite the exploits of the English Justinian, we were
still far from a legislature composed of the Three
Estates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a profusion of articles, Maitland was
correcting old mistakes and throwing out pregnant
suggestions in many departments of legal theory.
The principal ideas which are to be found not only
in his work upon the <cite>History of Law</cite> but in his
subsequent speculations on Corporateness and Communalism
were already in his mind during the early
days of work at Downing. In his lectures on Constitutional
History, delivered in 1888, he gave a description
of English medieval land-tenure which substantially
corresponds to the more complete exposition of the
<cite>History</cite> in 1895, and had already hit upon that comparison
between the course of feudal land-law in
England and Germany, which runs, a brilliant shaft
of illumination, through his whole treatment of the
subject. In Bracton's explanation that the rector of
a parish church is debarred from a writ of right his
keen eye had detected, as early as 1891, "the nascent
law about corporations aggregate and corporations sole."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>He had already begun to apply dissolvent legal
tests to "our easy talk of village communities." The
English village, he remarked in 1892, "owns no land,
and, according to our common law, it is incapable of
owning land. It never definitely attained to a juristic
personality." The village community of the picturesque
easy-going antiquarian, who, fascinated by Maine's
beautiful generalisations, was ready to find traces of
archaic communism in every quarter, only reminded
him of the remark in Scott's <cite>Antiquary</cite> "Pretorian
here Pretorian there I mind the bigging o't." In two
weighty articles contributed to the <cite>Law Quarterly
Review</cite> in 1893 upon the subject of Archaic Communities,
Maitland pricked some antiquarian bubbles
with delicious dexterity and threw out a suggestion
that the formula of development should be "neither
from communalism to individualism" nor yet "from
individualism to communalism" but from "the vague
to the definite." In common with Hegel he believed
that the world process consisted in the development
of the spirit of reason becoming more and more articulate
with every fresh discrimination of the intellect.</p>

<p>By amazing industry and a most rigid economy of
time Maitland had combined with his professional
duties and with the publication of several volumes
of unprinted matter the composition of an elaborate
treatise upon medieval law. The <cite>History of English
Law up to the time of Edward I</cite> appeared in 1895.
The work had been planned in conjunction with
Maitland's old friend, Sir Frederick Pollock, was
revised in common with him and issued under their
joint names; but as Sir Frederick explained in a note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
appended to the Preface "by far the greater share of
the execution" both in respect of the writing and the
research belonged to Maitland. The book at once
took rank as a classic. In range and quality of knowledge
it invited comparison with the monumental
achievement of Stubbs; and though it was necessarily
of a highly technical character, the style was so easy
and lucid that persons previously unversed in the
technicalities of medieval, or indeed of modern, law,
were able to read it with enjoyment.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the book deals advisedly
with a comparatively limited period,&mdash;the age which
lies between 1154 and 1272. "It is a luminous age
throwing light on both past and future. It is an
age of good books, the time of Glanvill and Richard
FitzNeal, of Bracton and Matthew Paris, an age
whose wealth of cartularies, manorial surveys and
plea-rolls has of recent years been in part, though
only in part, laid open before us in print. Its law is
more easily studied than the law of a later time, when
no lawyer wrote a treatise, and when the judicial
records had grown to so unwieldy a bulk that we
can hardly hope that much will ever be known about
them. The Year Books&mdash;more especially in their
present disgraceful plight&mdash;- must be very dark to us
if we cannot go behind them and learn something
about the growth of those 'forms of action' which
the fourteenth century inherited as the framework of
its law. And if the age of Glanvill and Bracton throws
light forward, it throws light backward also. Our one
hope of interpreting the <cite>Leges Henrici</cite>, that almost
unique memorial of the really feudal stage of legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
history, our one hope of coercing Domesday Book to
deliver up its hoarded secrets, our one hope of making
an Anglo-Saxon land-book mean something definite,
seems to lie in an effort to understand the law of the
Angevin time as though we ourselves lived in it."</p>

<p>Perhaps the most distinct impression which the
reader derives from the study of Maitland's work in
the <cite>History</cite> is that he "seemed to understand the law
of the Angevin time as though he himself lived in it."
We feel that, if he had been going circuit with Walter
Raleigh or William Pateshull, his learned brethren
would have had little or nothing to tell him which he
did not already know. The case law of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries&mdash;so far as it has survived in
plea-rolls or chronicles or legal collections&mdash;was part of
the familiar furniture of his mind. He knew it all and
enjoyed it all in every one of its facets human and
lawyerly. And with this he combined a remarkable
capacity for appreciating the general tone and colour
of legal thinking in that remote age. If the thinking
was fluid and indistinct, Maitland would not attempt
to make it clearer or more consistent than it really
was. The vagueness would be analysed and measured.
The opaque thought would be exhibited in its fluctuating
and conflicting subconscious elements. We
are always being reminded of that wise saying in
the Fellowship Dissertation, that English political
philosophy has suffered by overmuch simplicity.</p>

<p>A mind so exact and disinterested and endowed
with so rare a capacity for divesting itself of the
intellectual accretions of its own age was naturally
full of dissolvents for ambitious theories. Maitland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
expressed in his Inaugural lecture his high respect
for the genius and learning of Henry Maine, and
nothing which was then written would have been
afterwards retracted. Yet the close study of English
medieval law had brought him to the conclusion that
some of the generalisations to which Maine seemed
disposed to assign a general validity, at least for the
Indo-Germanic races, received no adequate support
from the English evidence. In a brilliant discussion
of the antiquities of inheritance he argues that in the
present state of the evidence it would be rash to accept
"family ownership," or in other words a strong form
of birth-right, as an institution which once prevailed
among the English in England. Maine, operating
chiefly with Roman law but also drawing upon
Teutonic, Slavonic and even Indian evidence, had
argued that the primitive unit of society was an
agnatic patriarchal group and that the ownership of
land was vested in a family or clan constructed on
strict agnatic principles and governed by the paterfamilias.
Maitland submits the conception of common
ownership to analysis. Common ownership implies
corporate ownership, and the idea of a corporation is
modern, not primitive. Co-ownership indeed there
was, but co-ownership spells individualism. If there
is a law which declares how shares should be distributed
among the members of the group upon partition,
then there is a law which assigns ideal shares in the
unpartitioned land. There was no proof that anything
which ought to be called family-ownership existed
among the Anglo-Saxons; there was no proof of the
patriarchal <i lang="la">gens</i>, of the agnatic group. On the contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
there was a grave difficulty in accepting the patriarchal
family as the primitive unit of English society, for
the earliest rules about Anglo-Saxon inheritance and
the Anglo-Saxon blood-feud exhibit the fact that "the
persons who must bear the feud and who may share
the weregild are partly related through the father and
partly through the mother." Birth-rights indeed there
were, but birth-rights do not imply agnation or corporate
ownership. In some cases they may even be the consequence
of intestate succession. Submitted to concrete
tests of this character the evidence for the strict agnatic
land-owning group in England became in Maitland's
eyes very ghostly<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. "In Agnation," wrote Maine,
"is to be sought the explanation of that extraordinary
rule of English law which prohibited brothers of the
half-blood from succeeding to one another's lands."
Maitland's solution of "this extraordinary rule" is
very different and highly characteristic of his concrete,
practical turn of mind. In his opinion it is "neither
a very ancient nor a very deep-seated phenomenon."
He points out that the problem of dealing with the
half-blood must always be difficult, and the solution is
always likely to be capricious. "The lawyers of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had no definite
solution, and we strongly suspect that the rule that
was ultimately established had its origin in a few
precedents...." "Our rule was one eminently favourable
to the King; it gave him escheats; we are not sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>that any profounder explanation of it would be
true."</p>

<p>In Maitland's hands a treatise upon antiquarian
law became something greater than an antiquarian
treatise. It became a contribution to the general
history of human society. Even the most superficial
reader must be struck by the number of foreign books
quoted in the footnotes and by the way in which
analogues and contrasts from French and German
law are brought in to illustrate the course of our
legal history. English law became insular; pursued
a course of its own. We avoided torture; we escaped
the secret and inquisitorial procedure of the continent;
we developed the jury; primogeniture became the
general rule among us in case of intestacy; the <i lang="fr">retrait
lignager</i> of the French customs did not become established
in our land-law. But just for this reason it
was the more necessary to understand the main stream
of continental development. Many a rule which, if
considered from a purely insular standpoint, might
seem part of the natural order, would assume its true
character of a deviation from the normal, if viewed in
the larger context of European law; many features
of our law apparently arbitrary would in that larger
context receive explanation. Maitland takes care to
know that which was known to Glanvill and Bracton;
but he does not for that reason neglect Brunner or
Gierke, Esmein or Viollet. A piece of continental
evidence suggested by the history of the Inquisition
points to the reason why in England alone the public
trial of primitive Teutonic civilisation survived through
the Middle Ages. It survived because the Inquisition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was never introduced into this country, and England
had no Inquisition because at the critical period it was
singularly unfertile in heresy.</p>

<p>"It has generally been apprehended," writes Reeves
in the Preface to the First Edition of the <cite>History of
English Law</cite> (1783), "that much light might be
thrown on our statutes by the civil history of the
times in which they were made; but it will be found
on enquiry that these expectations are rarely satisfied."
It would be difficult to find in a single sentence a more
complete measure of the gulf which separates Pollock
and Maitland's <cite>History of English Law</cite> from the book
which it supplanted. Reeves wrote in an unhistorical
age and with imperfect materials. "Let us think,"
wrote Maitland, "what Reeves had at his disposal,
what we have at our disposal. He had the Statute
Book, the Year Books in a bad and clumsy edition,
the old text-books in bad and clumsy editions. He
made no use of Domesday Book; he had not the
<cite>Placitorum Abbreviatio</cite> nor Palgrave's <cite>Rotuli Curiæ
Regis</cite>; he had no Parliament rolls, Pipe, Patent, Close,
Fine, Hundred Rolls, no proceedings of the King's
Council, no early Chancery proceedings, not a cartulary,
not a manorial extent nor a manorial roll; he had not
Nichol's <cite>Britton</cite>, nor Pike's nor Harwood's <cite>Year
Books</cite>, nor Stubbs' <cite>Select Charters</cite>, nor Bigelow's
<cite>Placita Anglo-Normannica</cite>; he had no collection of
Anglo-Saxon land-books, only a very faulty collection
of Anglo-Saxon dooms, while the early history of law
in Normandy was utter darkness." And in addition to
this he did not believe that the general history of a
people could throw illumination upon its law. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
a sufficient commentary upon such a view to read
Maitland's opening paragraph upon the Norman
Conquest.</p>

<p>The state of English law in the twelfth century
cannot be explained unless we look beyond the strict
legal sphere. Explanations which seemed adequate
even to the great Stubbs&mdash;the action of race upon
race, the fusion of law with law, the analogy of a river
formed by two streams, of a chemical compound formed
of two elements&mdash;do not satisfy Maitland. The process
was far more complex. It was affected by influences
which had nothing whatever to do with the law of
Normandy or with the law of England before the
Conquest, by the rebellion of the Norman feudatories,
by the characters of certain great men, by the strong
political centralization, even by so accidental a fact
as that the Conqueror had three sons instead of
one. Economic, political, personal forces must all be
reckoned up in the account.</p>

<p>While the pages of the <cite>History</cite> were passing
through the press, two other works had been planned
and were already partially accomplished. In his
edition of the <cite>Note Book</cite> Maitland had proclaimed
the necessity for a new edition of Bracton, an edition
based not upon inferior manuscripts but upon the best
manuscripts, and accompanied by an adequate critical
apparatus. Such a task would demand many years
of painful toil and Maitland had more pressing calls
upon his energies. Nevertheless he regarded it as
important to arrive at a definite conclusion with
regard to one fundamental question respecting his
favourite author. What was the precise extent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
character of Bracton's indebtedness to Roman Law?
Sir Henry Maine in his famous lectures upon <cite>Ancient
Law</cite>, published in 1860, went so far as to assert that
Bracton "put off on his countrymen as a compendium
of pure English law a treatise of which the entire form
and two thirds of the contents was directly borrowed
from the <cite>Corpus Juris</cite>." But the amount of matter
which Bracton directly borrowed from the <cite>Corpus
Juris</cite> was comparatively insignificant, "not a thirteenth
part of the book"; the Devonshire justice went for his
Roman law not to the original springs but to a famous
Italian doctor. Dr Carl Guterbock established the fact
that large portions of Bracton's <cite>De Legibus</cite> were derived
from the works of Azo, a Bolognese Jurist who
flourished at the end of the twelfth and at the beginning
of the thirteenth century, and whose fame endured
throughout the Middle Ages. But what was the precise
measure of Bracton's obligation to "the master
of all the masters of the laws"? It was Maitland's
opinion that the debt might easily be overstated. In
order that the matter might be thoroughly cleared up
he planned a volume for the Selden Society which
should exhibit in parallel columns the text of the
Bolognese <cite>Summa</cite> and the corresponding portions of
Bracton. From this he drew three conclusions, that
Bracton's obligations to Roman Jurisprudence were
small in extent, that Bracton was an indifferent
Romanist, and thirdly that Bracton only borrowed
from Roman law when he had no English cases to
cite. Bracton was, in fact, a thorough Englishman.
Like everyone else in the Middle Ages he regarded
Roman law as a source of authority to which recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
should be had when the stock of home-bred law ran
out, but it was improbable that he had ever received
a University training in the <i lang="la">Leges</i> and it is certain
that he was far more comfortable with his English
writs and his English plea-rolls than with the elegant
refinements of the Code or the Digest.</p>

<p>"Bracton and Azo" did more than define the
"Romanesque" quality of the great treatise; it was a
brilliant contribution to the scholarly edition of the
future. The best manuscript (<cite>Bodl. Digby 222</cite>) was
minutely described, four others carefully collated, and
fifteen in all examined. One of the features of
the Digby manuscript, which, though not a perfect
copy of the autograph, appeared to Maitland on
many grounds to be the best approach to the
autograph to which research had attained, was the
presence of a large mass of additional matter written
in the margins. Now these marginalia were not
glosses but additions to the text and additions possessing
a peculiar value from the fact that they came from
Bracton himself. "If the annotator was not Bracton he
had just Bracton's interests and just Bracton's style."
In later manuscripts some or all of this supplementary
matter is received into the text but "too often at
inappropriate places." Accordingly the future editor
of the Treatise will be obliged to pay special heed to
these "addiciones"; and, to smooth a path which will
be none too easy, Maitland made a list of more than
a hundred and fifty passages in the printed text of
1869 which in the Digby manuscript stand in the
margin. Such labour occupying but a few pages of
Appendix looks but a small thing on paper, and is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
technical to interest the general reader: but scholars
will measure the devotion which it implies; and the
future edition of the <cite>De Legibus</cite> will be based on the
results of Maitland's unsparing toil among the Bracton
manuscripts in London and Oxford, Cheltenham and
Eton.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII.</a></h2>


<p>In the summer vacation of 1895 Maitland wrote as
follows to his friend, Mr R. L. Poole, the editor of the
<cite>English Historical Review</cite>:</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of asking you to let me
have a talk about Domesday. I have a great deal
of stuff written. Some of it Round has forestalled, as
I knew he would. At one time it was to have gone
into the book that Pollock and I published. Then I
did not wish to collide with Round and now I know
that Vinogradoff is again at work, and there are many
economic and social questions which I would rather
leave to him. So I have not and shall not have
enough that is new to make a book. On the other
hand I have a few legal theories that I should like
to put before the public in one form or another.
What do you think? Would the <cite>E. H. R.</cite> bear a little
Domesday&mdash;two or three articles? However I will
stand out of Frederick Pollock's way if he has anything
to say, so when you have ascertained his intentions
will you tell me whether you would take some papers
from me. I would begin with some talk about Round's
work of which I think very highly. I hope that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
will say first what you think; in no case shall I be
disappointed."</p>

<p>The publication of the <cite>Domesday Inquest</cite> was begun
in 1783 and completed in 1816 and in the whole range
of English history there is no authority alike so crucial
in importance and so difficult of interpretation. Of the
value of this unique statistical record compiled from
the returns of local jurors twenty years after the
Norman Conquest there has never been any dispute.
Long before the text was published it was the subject
of antiquarian monographs and the established base of
local histories and genealogical enquiries. Transcripts
of parts of Domesday were scattered up and down the
country in public and private collections, and its fame
was spread by the testimony of John Selden, who pronounced
that, so far as he knew, it was by several
centuries the oldest official record extant in autograph
in the whole Christian world. The enterprise of the
Record Commission made the record accessible to the
student, and a popular Introduction to Domesday,
written by Sir Henry Ellis in 1833, provided a pleasant
quarry for the general historian whose soul was not
vexed by the fundamental problems of Anglo-Norman
society and finance.</p>

<p>But the survey was not understood. Even Freeman,
who devoted to it a whole chapter in the fifth
volume of the <cite>Norman Conquest</cite>, did not attack the
central difficulties. He was a political historian, and
appreciated the political interest of the record; but
this is not the main interest. The survey owes its
chief importance to the fact that it exhibits the social,
economic and legal condition of the English people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
twenty years after the shock of the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>Light gradually broke in from the labours of the
specialist, from Eyton and Hamilton and above all
from Mr Horace Round, who, in two brilliant papers
composed for the Domesday Commemoration of 1888,
cleared up some of the crucial questions connected with
Domesday measures and Domesday finance. But perhaps
the most exciting contribution proceeded from a
book which was neither the work of a professed specialist
nor yet a Domesday monograph. Mr Seebohm's
<cite>English Village Community</cite> appeared in 1876 and
gave English readers for the first time a luminous
account of that system of medieval husbandry which the
enclosures of the eighteenth century did not entirely avail
to obliterate<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. Alike in its methods and conclusions
the <cite>English Village Community</cite> was an epoch-making
book. Reversing the ordinary chronological procedure
and arguing from comparatively recent periods, where
evidence is abundant, past the cartularies and extents
of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, past Domesday
to the twilight of the Saxon land-books and the darker
regions beyond, Mr Seebohm arrived at the conclusion
that the English village community was the outgrowth
of the Roman vill and that whatever might have been
the case in other regions of national life there was no
breach in the continuity of agrarian history. A bold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>challenge was flung against the tradition accepted by a
line of distinguished scholars from Kemble and Von
Maurer to Freeman and Stubbs. The English village
community was the offspring, not of a community of
Teuton freemen, but of a system moulded by the Latin
genius and rooted in slavery. The influence of Roman
Britain was not so insignificant after all, nor was the
completeness of the Teutonic Conquest so complete.
In the most fundamental part of her economic and
social texture England was indebted not to Germany
but to Rome. The battle between the Germanists and
the Romanists brought into clearer relief the importance
of Domesday studies. Questions of Domesday
nomenclature&mdash;the meaning for instance of the Domesday
hide&mdash;acquired a new relevance, and might turn
the scale in grave issues. A large hide of a hundred
and twenty acres would naturally imply an early society
of free peasant proprietors, a small hide of thirty acres
might, on the contrary, be fitted into the Romanist
hypothesis. Domesday was the key to the position.
Properly interpreted, it would not only explain the
influence of the Conquest, but throw light upon the
Anglo-Saxon land-system and the obscure problem of
agrarian origins. Mr Round's further contributions to
the understanding of the Record, which were published
in <cite>Feudal England</cite> in 1895, were recognised as
having a bearing upon the largest problems of English
history.</p>

<p>It was left to Sir Frederick Pollock to appraise
Mr Round's work in the pages of the <cite>English Historical
Review</cite>. Maitland's researches, which were pushed to
a conclusion with astonishing rapidity, appeared in 1896<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in a volume entitled <cite>Domesday Book and Beyond&mdash;Three
Essays in the Early History of England</cite>.
The first essay was called "Domesday Book," the
second "England before the Conquest," the third
"The Hide." The title was chosen to indicate
the fact that Maitland had followed the retrogressive
method from the known to the unknown which
Mr Seebohm had pursued with such admirable effect.
"Domesday Book appears to me not as the known
but as the knowable. The Beyond is still very dark:
but the way to it lies through the Norman record. The
result is given to us; the problem is to find cause and
process."</p>

<p>Identity of method, however, did not imply identical
conclusions. Eight years before Maitland had revised
the sheets of a remarkable study of <cite>Villainage in
England</cite>, by Paul Vinogradoff, the conclusions of which
were decidedly adverse to the Romanist hypothesis of
servile origins; but whereas Vinogradoff had confined
himself to the analysis of agrarian conditions as revealed
by the post-Domesday evidence, Maitland made his
assault upon the mysterious fortress of the great
survey itself. "That in some sort I have been
endeavouring to answer Mr Seebohm, I cannot conceal
from myself or from others. A hearty admiration of
his <cite>English Village Community</cite> is one main source
of this book. That the task of disputing his conclusions
might have fallen to stronger hands than mine I well
know. I had hoped that by this time Professor Vinogradoff's
<cite>Villainage in England</cite> would have had a
sequel. When that sequel comes (and may it come
soon) my provisional answer can be forgotten."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>All scientific work is in a sense provisional, and
<cite>Domesday Book and Beyond</cite> contains some theories
which we believe that Maitland would have subsequently
revised. But whether it be regarded as a
model of acute and substantial investigation, or weighed
by the mass of its contributions to the permanent
fabric of historical understanding and knowledge, it
will assuredly rank among the classical monographs of
historical science. Maitland did not profess to cover
the whole field of economic and social development.
He approached the history of the eleventh century
mainly as a lawyer anxious to analyse the legal conceptions
of that age, and fully conscious of the extreme
difficulty and delicacy of his task. "The grown man,"
he remarks, "will find it easier to think the thoughts
of the schoolboy than to think the thoughts of the
baby. And yet the doctrine that our remote forefathers
being simple folk had simple law dies hard.
Too often we allow ourselves to suppose that, could
we but get back to the beginning, we should find that
all was intelligible and should then be able to watch
the process whereby simple ideas were smothered
under subtleties and technicalities. But it is not so.
Simplicity is the outcome of technical subtlety; it is
the goal not the starting-point. As we go backwards
the familiar outlines become blurred; the ideas become
fluid, and instead of the simple we find the indefinite....
We must not be in a hurry to get to the beginning of
the long history of law. Very slowly we are making
our way towards it. The history of law must be a
history of ideas. It must represent not merely what
people have done and said, but what men have thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in bygone ages. The task of reconstructing ancient
ideas is hazardous and can only be accomplished little
by little. In particular there lies a besetting danger
for us in the barbarian's use of a language which is too
good for his thought. Mistakes then are easy, and
when committed they will be fatal and fundamental
mistakes. If for example we introduce the <i lang="la">persona
ficta</i> too soon, we shall be doing worse than if we
armed Hengest and Horsa with machine guns or
pictured the Venerable Bede correcting proofs for the
press; we shall have built upon a crumbling foundation."
The main argument of the book was directed
against the view that the English manorial system
was the outcome of the Roman villa. The English
language, the names of our English villages, were
sufficient to rebut the hypothesis that the bulk of the
agricultural population was of Celtic blood descended
from the slaves or <i lang="la">coloni</i> of Roman times. Romanism
would give no rational explanation of the state of
things revealed by the Domesday survey in the
northern and eastern counties. Nor would it explain
seignorial justice. It was shown that at the
time of the survey England was still incompletely
manorialised, that the Domesday manors varied indefinitely
in size and type, that some had freeholders, some
not, that in some there were courts, in others none,
and that no general proposition respecting either jurisdictional
rights or agrarian continuity would apply to
them universally. That the manors of Domesday were
mainly tilled by villeins who in a certain sense were
unfree, was doubtless true, but there was evidence to
show that the position of the agricultural class had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
deteriorated during the period which elapsed between
the Conquest and the survey, and many calamities
natural or fiscal, a murrain, a hailstorm, a levy of
Danegeld, a judicial fine, might be enumerated to
account for a gradual decline in the status of the rural
population during the Saxon age.</p>

<p>Evidence from an entirely different quarter supported
the main conclusion. Far back at the beginning
of the eighth century Bede had spoken of the hide as
the normal holding of the English householder. By
a train of very subtle and elaborate calculations
Maitland came to the conclusion that the hide of which
Bede spoke and to which Domesday testifies contained
120 arable acres,&mdash;a tenement too large for any serf or
semi-servile <i lang="la">colonus</i> and therefore precluding the idea
that the manorial system was dominant in England
in very early Saxon times. How then did the system
arise? Maitland advanced an ingenious hypothesis,
admitting, "that nothing which could be called a strict
proof could be offered"&mdash;that the word <i lang="la">manerium</i> as
used by the Domesday commissioners possessed a
technical sense. Domesday was a fiscal inquest; the
object of the commissioners was the collection of geld;
geld is collected from persons who live in houses and
the word <i lang="la">manerium</i> means a house. For the fiscal
purpose of these Norman officials <i lang="la">manerium</i> meant
"the house at which geld is charged." The lord, in
other words, was made responsible to the state for the
payment of geld from his demesne land and the land
of his villeins, and was bound to take measures to see
that the tax was paid by such freemen and socmen as
might be attached to his manor. The theory was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of course intended to provide a solution for the main
problem. It suggested an answer to the question
"What is the technical meaning attached to the word
<i lang="la">manerium</i> in Domesday?" it revealed one of the
possible forces which may have contributed to manorial
dependence: but it did not explain or pretend to
explain either the forces which made for the subjection
of the peasantry to seignorial justice or the peculiar
system of ownership and cultivation which was distinctive
of the manor.</p>

<p>The problem was no doubt mainly economic, but it
possessed its legal aspect. A brilliant analysis of
Anglo-Saxon <i lang="ang">diplomata</i>, which could hardly have been
accomplished save by a practised lawyer, revealed the
fact that the Anglo-Saxon kings had been freely
alienating public powers, fiscal and jurisdictional, to
churches and private persons. The Saxon land-book
does not transfer land, but superiorities over land. It
may be true that the gift has all the appearance of
being unconditional, "granted as a reward for past
services, not as a condition for the performance of
future services"; but the contrast between the deeds
of the Saxon and Norman period is one rather of form
than of substance. Every Saxon grant of "immunities"
reserves the "trinoda necessitas," that fundamental
military obligation which lay upon every freeman, and
if that service was not performed the land was forfeit
to the king. Then again land-loans were not uncommon,
and land-loans and land-gifts shaded imperceptibly
into one another. All the lineaments of the
feudal land system are already visible in the later
Anglo-Saxon period. The feudal formula of dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
tenure is known; the exercise of jurisdictional rights
by private persons is a familiar fact; in places one
could even see, "a four-storied feudal edifice." No
large historical transformation is matter for unqualified
regret. Feudalism was a necessary stage in the education
and development of the barbarian world. "There
are indeed historians who have not yet abandoned the
habit of speaking of feudalism as though it were a
disease of the body politic. Now the word feudalism
is and always will be an inexact term, and, no doubt, at
various times and places there emerge phenomena
which may with great propriety be called feudal, and
which come of evil and make for evil. But if we use
the term, and often we do, in a very wide sense, then
feudalism will appear to us as a natural and even a
necessary stage in our history. If we use the term in
this wide sense, then (the barbarian conquests being
given to us as an unalterable fact) feudalism means
civilisation, the separation of employment, a division
of labour, the possibility of national defence, the possibility
of art, science, literature and learned leisure; the
cathedral, the scriptorium, the library are as truly the
work of feudalism as is the baronial castle."</p>

<p>One of the inevitable consequences of the process
was a confusion in legal ideas. Distinctions which in
the classical Roman law were clearly drawn became
obliterated in the Middle Ages. Ownership and
sovereignty, rents and taxes, public and private rights,
became blended together in one large, hazy, undistinguished
concept. Even the contrast between freedom
and unfreedom which appears to the modern mind so
elementary and so logical did not fit the intricate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
economic facts of the eleventh century. Of freedom
there were many grades and many criteria. In one
sense the villein was free, in another sense unfree, as
a combination of forces fiscal, economic, penal were
assimilating the rural population free and servile to
the hybrid type. "Freedom is measured along several
different scales. At one time it is to the power of
alienation or withdrawal that attention is attracted, at
another to the number and kind of services and
'customs' that the man must render to his lord." The
closer the facts of Domesday were scrutinised the more
impossible did it appear to arrive at exact definitions.</p>

<p>Maitland's subtle powers of analysis were never
shown to better advantage than in this attempt to
rethink "the common thoughts of our forefathers, their
common thoughts about common things." We doubt
whether any historian had ever set himself down so
seriously to get inside the medieval mind. The pompous
phraseology in the early <i lang="ang">diplomata</i> does not
deceive him, for he knows that the romanesque terms
neither express the thoughts nor represent the facts of
a barbarian age. Large phrases confidently used by
modern historians, such as "property" or "joint
liability," must be closely scrutinised before they can
be applied to a remote age; property is a bundle of
rights, and with every advance in economic progress,
in material aspirations, in intellectual definition, rights
and powers multiply, the conception of <i lang="la">dominium</i>
becomes more intensive, fuller of content and discriminations.
There is no fixed immutable limit to the
implications of such a concept. The Saxon chieftain
learnt the extent of his powers in the process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
alienating them to the Church, as some African chieftain
tempted by gin and rifles may acquire a knowledge
that land is not made for sheep alone, but may also
yield gold and diamonds. But as the barbarian is
vague, so also he is for all his materialism an idealist.
"He sees things not as they are but as they might
conveniently be. Every householder has a hide;
every hide has 120 acres of arable; every hide is worth
one pound a year; every householder has a team;
every team is of eight oxen; every team is worth one
pound. If all this be not so, then it ought to be so,
and must be deemed to be so. Then by a Procrustean
system he packs the complex and irregular facts into
his scheme!" It is no light enterprise to understand
the puzzled and inadequate thought which lies at the
basis of our social history; Maitland believed that the
reward was worthy of the effort.</p>

<p>It appeared to Maitland that one of the obstacles
to an exact understanding of the past was the general
acceptance of the idea that a normal programme could
be laid down for the human race. Even if there were
sufficient evidence to show that each independent
portion of the human race must move through a fated
series of changes, it remained a fact that the rapidly
progressive groups had not been independent. "Our
Anglo-Saxon ancestors did not arrive at the alphabet
or at the Nicene Creed by traversing a long series of
'stages'; they leapt to the one and to the other." And
again the complexity and interdependence of human
affairs render it impossible to hope for scientific laws
which will formulate a sequence of stages in any one
province of men's activity. Consequently it was un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>wise
to fill up the blanks that occurred in the history
of one nation by institutions and processes which had
been observed in another quarter. Even if it were
proved that the Roman <i lang="la">gens</i> was a close agnatic group,
and that the house community was the primitive unit
of Roman society, we should not "force our reluctant
forefathers through agnatic <i lang="la">gentes</i> and house communities."
In particular we were not entitled to assume
without further enquiry that the early English village
community owned land.</p>

<p>Such criticisms, implying as they did that the
Roman evidence had been accredited with a wider
relevance than it did or could possess, were calculated
to abate the more sanguine claims alike of comparative
jurisprudence and of anthropology. In a subsequent
paper contributed to the Eranus Club Maitland recurred
to his central thesis, that the experience of the
progressive nations was interdependent and unique,
and incapable, for that very reason, of affording a basis
for an inductive science of politics. It is among the
many refreshing qualities of Maitland's work that while
he is always close to his facts he is never out of the
atmosphere of large and animating ideas.</p>

<p>In the matter of early English land-holding
Maitland put the individualist case with great cogency.
While admitting co-operation he did not find decisive
evidence of common ownership either in town or
country. The village community was not a body that
could declare the law of the tribe or nation. It had
no court, no jurisdiction. If moots were held in it,
these would be comparable rather to meetings of
shareholders than to sessions of a tribunal. In short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the village landowners formed a group of men whose
economic affairs were inextricably intermixed; but this
was almost the only principle that made them a unit,
unless and until the state began to use the township as
its organ for the maintenance of the peace and the
collection of the taxes. That is the reason why we
read little of the township in our Anglo-Saxon dooms.
Even in the German community there was a solid core
of individualism! It is possible that Maitland overrated
the "automatic" character of early agrarian life;
that he argued too much from the silence of the
dooms, that his principal tests were too predominantly
legal; and that more may be said for the older theory
than he was able at that time to discover in <cite>Domesday
Book and Beyond</cite>. But the considerations which he
submitted were substantial considerations, and in any
picture which is drawn of the early state of land-holding
in this country room will have to be made for a measure
of individualism, if not equal to that which Maitland
claimed, greater at least than the earlier theory had
admitted.</p>

<p>In the course of his researches for the <cite>History of
English Law</cite> Maitland had been drawn into the
unfamiliar region of ecclesiastical jurisprudence, a department
of knowledge once of the highest importance
throughout Europe, but, save for one exception, fallen
into complete desuetude at the English Universities
ever since the study of the Canon Law was proscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
by Henry VIII. The exception was provided by
William Stubbs. That great master of medieval
history had from his Oxford Chair delivered and
subsequently published two lectures upon the Canon
Law in England. A stout patriot and a high Anglican,
Stubbs was concerned to exhibit the continuity of the
English Church before and after the Reformation; and
both in his Oxford lectures and in a famous report
drawn up for the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical
Courts he gave the weight of his authority to the
opinion that the Canon Law of Rome, though held
to be of great authority in England during the Middle
Ages, was not recognised to be binding on the Courts
Christian of this country. The verdict of so fine a
scholar was eagerly welcomed by men of High Church
opinions. If the Canon Law was not binding, then
the Church of England was never in the full sense
ultramontane, and the changes of the sixteenth century
did not amount to revolution. Zealots went further
still. There were those who, as Maitland wittily observed,
seemed to believe that the Church of England
was "Protestant before the Reformation and Catholic
afterwards."</p>

<p>In the quarrel between the Highs and Lows
Maitland had no interest. Then, as always, he was a
dissenter from all the Churches: but historical truth
was precious to him, and in the course of the summer
of 1895, while engaged in the preparation of a course
of lectures upon the Canon Law, he became gradually
aware that the received opinion could no longer stand.
The agent of his conversion, if conversion it can be
called, was the <cite>Provinciale</cite> of William Lyndwood, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
popular text-book written in 1430 by the principal
official of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and representative
of the accepted opinion in the century
preceding the Protestant Reformation. The following
letter to Mr R. L. Poole explains the genesis of a
book which has permanently deflected the current of
historical opinion.</p>

<p>I ought to have been writing lectures about the
history of the Canon Law. Instead of so doing I
have been led away into a lengthy discourse on
Lyndwood. I have come to a result that seems to
be heterodox, but I do not know exactly how heterodox
it is and should be extremely grateful if you
would give me your opinion upon a question which
lies rather within your studies than within mine. It
seems to me clear, that in Lyndwood's view the law
laid down in the three great papal law-books is statute
law for the English ecclesiastical courts and overrules
all the provincial constitutions, and further that apart
from the law contained in these books the Church of
England has hardly any law&mdash;in short there is next
to nothing that can be called <em>English</em> Canon Law.
I must wait until I am again in Cambridge to read
what has been written about this matter in modern
times, but any word of counsel that you can give me
will be treasured. From a remark that you once
made I inferred that in your opinion our Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
historians have been too patriotic. I feel pretty sure
of this after spending two months with Lyndwood,
and if I find that my conclusions about the law of our
ecclesiastical courts are at variance with the prevailing
doctrine, may be I shall print what I have been
writing, that is to say if either <cite>L. Q. R.</cite> or <cite>E. H. R.</cite>,
will let me trail my coat through its pages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><cite>Roman Canon Law in the Church of England</cite>
appeared in 1898. It was a collection of six essays,
one of which&mdash;the delightful story of the Deacon who
turned Jew for the love of a Jewess&mdash;had been published
as far back as 1886. Of the rest the decisive
part consisted of articles contributed to the <cite>English
Historical Review</cite> in 1896 and 1897. So far as a
case can be demolished by argument, the case for
the legal continuity of the Church in England was
demolished by Maitland. He proved that the Popes'
decretals were regarded as absolutely binding by our
English canonists; that throughout Christendom the
Pope was regarded as the Universal Ordinary or
supreme source of Jurisdiction; that a considerable
portion of the Canon Law was built out of English
cases; that the provincial constitutions in England
were of the nature of bye-laws and insignificant, while
the libraries of our canonists were filled with foreign
treatises; in fine, that the thirty-two Commissioners
who set their names to the opinion that the ecclesiastical
judges in England were not bound by the
statutes which the Popes had decreed for all the
faithful would have been condemned by any English
ecclesiastical tribunal in the Middle Ages as guilty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
heresy. No doubt portions of the Canon Law were
not as a matter of fact enforced in England, but this
was not because the Courts Christian rejected them,
but because the Temporal power would not permit
their enforcement.</p>

<p>Royal prohibitions did not prove the existence of
a national Canon Law. "To prove that we must see
an ecclesiastical judge, whose hands are free and who
has no 'prohibition' to fear, rejecting a decretal because
it infringes the law of the English Church or because
that Church has not received it." Whatever might
be the view of a late age, no such testimony was
forthcoming before the breach with Rome. Indeed
the "one great work of our English canonist in the
fifteenth century" showed that the position which had
been attributed to the English Church in the Middle
Ages was alien to its whole way of thought. In the
age of the conciliar movement, when men of liberal
temperament were urging that the Pope was subject
to a general council, William Lyndwood evidenced
nothing but "a conservative curialism."</p>

<p>The book was necessarily controversial, but written
with that complete absence of the polemical spirit
which characterised all Maitland's work. "I hope
and trust," he wrote to Mr Poole, September 12, 1898,
"that you were not very serious when you said that
the bishop was sore. I feel for him a respect so
deep, that if you told me that the republication of my
essays would make him more unhappy than a sane
man is whenever people dissent from him, I should be
in great doubt what to do. It is not too late to destroy
all or some of the sheets. I hate to bark at the heels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of a great man whom I admire, but tried hard to seem
as well as to be respectful."</p>

<p>An accident of friendship drew Maitland still further
into the tormented sea of controversial church history.
Lord Acton was appointed Regius Professor of Modern
History at Cambridge in 1895, and, despite radical
differences of creed and outlook, soon discovered in
Maitland a spirit as ardent and disinterested as his
own. Outwardly there was a great contrast between
the two men, Maitland frail and delicate, his pale eager
face a lamp of humour and curiosity, Acton massive,
reserved, deliberate; but they understood one another,
and soon came to share a common interest in a great
literary enterprise. One day Acton propounded to
Maitland the scheme for a great Cambridge history
written upon the combined plan which was already
familiar in France and Germany. It was to be a
Universal History, a history of the whole world from
the first beginnings to the present day, written by an
army of specialists, and concentrating the latest results
of special study. Maitland suggested that a more
modest plan, a history of modern Europe since the
Reformation, would prove to be more practical, and in
this view Acton concurred.</p>

<p>The <cite>Cambridge Modern History</cite> covered a period
which did not properly fall within Maitland's special
range of study; but he was taken into counsel as to
the general execution of the plan, and persuaded to
contribute a chapter upon the Anglican Settlement
and the Scottish Reformation. That Acton should
have chosen Maitland for this particular piece of work
may cause some surprise. The ground was intricate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
sown with pitfalls and clouded with controversy, and
Maitland had made no special study of the sixteenth
century upon the political or religious side. On the
other hand he could bring to the task a cool, dispassionate
judgment, a fine power for appraising
historical evidence, and a singular and exact felicity
in the expression of delicate shades of certainty and
doubt. That he stood outside the Churches might
have been a disqualification, had devotional impulses
been the staple consideration in the question, or if the
banners of rival confessions were not already waving
on the battle field; but the age of Elizabeth was
theological rather than religious, and it was of the first
importance to obtain the verdict of a thoroughly impartial
mind upon a subject which could never be
treated by a churchman without some suspicion
of partisanship attaching to his results. Maitland
accepted the task with misgivings, and discharged it
with characteristic thoroughness. In an astonishingly
short space of time his mind filled itself up with the
reports of French and Spanish ambassadors, with the
theological treatises and the political intrigues of sixteenth
century Europe. A month or so after he had
taken the plunge he was talking of Caraffa and Cecil
as if he had known them all his life, and seemed to
have gathered up the whole complicated web of
European policy into his hands. He did not content
himself with mastering and reproducing the voluminous
literature of the subject; some pretty little discoveries,
some "Elizabethan gleanings" were contributed to
the <cite>English Historical Review</cite>, and gave evidence of
refined investigations which did not stop at printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
material. Results which might have furnished the
theme for a substantial volume were packed into a
chapter of forty pages. Critics complained of obscurity
not of thought but of allusion; others, imperfectly
versed in Tudor history, of a defective sympathy
with religious emotion. The first charge is true; for
Maitland was undoubtedly over-allusive, not from
ostentation but from absorption and from a tendency
common to learned and modest men to credit the
general reader with more knowledge than he is likely
to possess. To the second allegation it is some reply
that Maitland was inclined to attribute the most
decisive act in the period, Elizabeth's resolve to reject
the Roman overtures, to religious rather than to
political motives.</p>

<p>With habitual modesty Maitland disclaimed the
possession of the gift of narration. He would say
that he could not tell a story; and the character of
his historical work was not adapted to exercise the
story-telling gift. But if his narrative has not the
liquid flow of some accredited masters of the art,
it is entirely devoid of some common defects. It is
never indefinite, flabby or verbose, on the contrary it
is full of pith and fire, proceeding by a series of brief
vivid touches which take root in the memory and ripen
there. It would be easy to select from the chapter
upon the Scottish Reformation and the Anglican
settlement a <em>florilegium</em> of passages which, for keenness
of insight and terseness of expression, could not
easily be surpassed. It is a style which gives the
impression not only of clairvoyance and watchfulness
as to small details, transient motives and ephemeral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
phases of opinion, but also of a sense of the fundamental
significance of things and of their relevance in
the general march of progress. Every stroke is made
to tell. In general nothing is so tedious as a history
constructed upon severe philosophical principles. The
argument swallows up the life; the characters become
faint and evanescent; the colour put upon one event
is shaded by the reflection of events which follow, and
an oft repeated major premise leads through an appropriate
selection of devitalised incidents to a familiar
conclusion. Maitland's fragment of Reformation history
is philosophical in the best sense. It is alive to
the ultimate principles of belief and conduct which
governed men and women in the years when the
Thirty-Nine Articles were in the making; but it is
also very vivid and concrete. The tale has been told
more fully, more comfortably, with a greater display of
picturesque circumstance, but never with more intellect,
or with so exact an appreciation of the chronological
order in which successive phases of belief and opinion
revealed themselves. Instead of history ready-made
Maitland gave us history in the making, antedating
nothing and excluding with a care no less scrupulous
than Gardiner's the world's knowledge of to-morrow
from the world's knowledge of to-day. More than
one fairy story dissolved at his touch, among others
the tale of a Convocation summoned in 1559 to
consent to the Act of Uniformity. The parent of the
legend, an Anglican Canon, with a comical misapprehension
of his antagonist's resources, ventured to
measure swords with Maitland who had exposed his
shortcomings in a Magazine. The encounter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
amusing and decisive. It was also characteristic of
some English peculiarities. We are a nation of bold
amateurs. A German pastor who had been corrected
by Savigny upon some points of history would hardly
have returned to the charge without betraying some
suspicion that his enterprise was unpromising if not
forlorn.</p>

<p>Not the least brilliant passage in <cite>Domesday Book
and Beyond</cite> was a novel theory as to the origin and
early history of the English Borough. The question
of municipal origins had produced a library of controversial
literature upon the Continent. One writer
developed the town from the feudal domain, another
from the "immunity," a third from the guild, a fourth
from the market, a fifth from the free village, and
there were combinations and permutations of these
and other factors. Maitland was impressed by the
arguments of Dr Keutgen of Jena, who found the
origin and criterion of the German borough in its
fortification. The idea transplanted into Maitland's
mind became surprisingly fruitful. Scattered fragments
of evidence seemed to confirm the surmise that
in the English Midlands at least the county town
was the county fortress, owing its origin to military
necessity and supported by a variety of artificial
arrangements. There was the evidence of language,
for borough originally means a fortified house; the
evidence of the map, for in many counties of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the county town is somewhere near the centre; the
evidence of warlike stress, for the Danes were foemen
even more terrible than those wild Hungarians against
whom Henry the Fowler built his Saxon "burhs";
the evidence of Domesday Book, showing contrivances
at once careful and varied for maintaining town walls
and town garrisons; and here and there a gleam of
light from older documents, from the Burghal Hidage
of the tenth century, or from a charter of King Alfred.
The argument, which was expounded with beautiful
clearness and ingenuity, led on to the conclusion that
the town court was the product of "tenural heterogeneity,"
for the garrison men holding of different
lords would need a special court to decide their controversies.
There was thus a greater degree of
governmental artifice in the process than had hitherto
been suspected. The borough was not merely a very
prosperous village; it was a unit in a scheme of
national defence; a fortified town maintained by a
district for military purposes with "mural houses"
and "knight guilds" and a miscellaneous garrison
contributed by shire thegns. By degrees trade, commerce,
agriculture, the interests of the market and the
town fields would overpower the military characteristics
of the county stronghold. But the scheme should not
be pressed too far; "no general theory will tell the
story of every or any particular town."</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1897 Maitland gave the Ford
Lectures in Oxford. The foundation was recent, and
Maitland was chosen to succeed S. R. Gardiner, who
had delivered the opening course in the previous year.
Gardiner had lectured extempore on "Cromwell's Place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
in History"; Maitland delivered a series of carefully
written dissertations upon "Township and Borough,"
a subject as little likely, one would think, to hold
together an audience in the Schools as any that could
be imagined. The ordinary man is not interested in
law, still less in medieval law, and less again in the
metaphysics of medieval law; but a large and constant
audience was interested in Maitland. His style of
lecturing was distinctive and original&mdash;the voice deep,
grave, expressive, the delivery dramatic, the substance
compounded of subtle speculation and playful wit and
recondite learning. The lectures which were learnt
by heart were delivered with a verve and earnestness
which impressed many a hearer who was entirely
indifferent to the particular issues or to the whole
region of learning to which they belonged. When
and how did the Borough become a Corporation?
Who owned the Town fields? In what sense was the
medieval borough a land-owning community? What
did King John mean when he granted the vill of
Cambridge to the burgesses and their heirs? With
Maitland's artful spells upon her Oxford felt that such
questions as these might be very grave and not a little
gay.</p>

<p>The wonderful work which has here been imperfectly
described was accomplished under a shadow.
Maitland, who was never really a strong man, was,
even before his marriage, not without warnings that
he was overtaxing his physical resources. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
he delivered his inaugural lecture he was already
conscious that his days might be few. "I see again,"
writes one who was present, "the dim room, the grey
light and the shadowy but inspired fragileness of the
lecturer who was then fighting a very serious illness....
It was no ordinary lecture, rather a sort of sermon,
grave and beautiful with its solemn call to work, even
though that work might lie in humble and obscure
fields. And the impression that was perhaps most
immediately insistent, seeming to underlie each word
and sentence, was that the speaker felt the hours of
his own work to be already numbered and but few."
In 1889, the year after his election to the Downing
Chair, a doctor pronounced over him a sentence from
which there is generally no successful appeal. "I
very much want to see you again," he wrote to a
friend, March 12, 1889, "and I don't know that I
can wait for another year; this I say rather seriously
and <em>only to you</em>; many things are telling me that I
have not got unlimited time at my command and
I have to take things very easily."</p>

<p>Devoted nursing, great care in diet, and a resolute
avoidance of many of the pleasant things of life enabled
the work to proceed as buoyantly as ever. There were
bouts of illness and pain, when the French novelist and
especially the beloved and well-known Balzac had to
be invoked, but there were also periods of revival and
at one time an assurance that the alarming symptoms
had disappeared. But in truth the malady was never
dislodged. "Slowly it is doing for me; but quite
slowly," he wrote to a friend in 1899, "and it may
cheer you to know that I have had ten happy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
busy years under the ban." In the summer and
autumn of that tenth year there was a sudden change
for the worse and it became clear that Maitland could
no longer winter in England. "If I have to sing
a Nunc Dimittis," he wrote to Mr R. L. Poole, "it
will run 'Quia oculi mei viderunt originalem Actum
de Uniformitate primi anni Reg. Eliz.' Few can say
as much.... I think of a voyage to S. America as
S. Africa looks too warm for a man of peace."</p>

<p>From 1898 the Maitlands were compelled to fly
south with the approach of winter. Their regular
resort was Grand Canary but once, in 1904, this was
exchanged for Madeira. Like all other habits idleness
requires cultivation and Maitland had never been
idle. Under a tropical sky and with an exquisite
sense of relief from physical pain he worked his
writing muscles as busily as ever. In the first exile
he translated that part of Otto Gierke's <cite>Deutsche
Genossenschaftrecht</cite>, which dealt with medieval political
theory, and published it with a brilliant Introduction.
Later he copied manuscripts of the Year Books lent
to him by the wise generosity of the Cambridge
University Library and collated or transcribed photographs
of those manuscripts which it was impossible to
export. The last two winters were divided between
the Year Books and the composition of a biography
of Leslie Stephen, and so far was exile from being
a holiday that the fruit of each winter spent in the
fortunate islands was never less than the substantial
part of the volume. Some letters shall speak of the
impressions and activities of these years.</p>

<p>I am beginning Guy Fawkes's day by sitting in
the verandah before breakfast to write letters for a
homeward-bound mail. Certainly it is enjoyable here
and I mean to get good out of a delightful climate.
Also I mean to convert your half promise of a visit
into a whole, and without going beyond the truth I
can say that there is a good deal here that should
please you. At first sight I was repelled by the arid
desolation of the island. I suppose that I ought to
have been prepared for grasslessness, but somehow
or another I was not. But then the wilderness is
broken by patches of wonderful green&mdash;the green of
banana fields. Wherever a little water can be induced
to flow in artificial channels there are all manner of
beautiful things to be seen. I have picked a date and
mustered enough Spanish to buy me a pair of shoes
in the "city" of Las Palmas&mdash;a dirty city it is with
strange smells; but we are well outside of it. Between
Las Palmas and its port there is a little English colony.
This hotel is so English that they give me my bill in
<em>£ s. d.</em> and my change in British ha'pence which have
seen better days. Indeed now I know where our
coppers go to when they have become too bad for use
at home. Also the "library" of this hotel seems a
sort of hades to which the bad three-voller is sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
after its decease. But the proposition that all the
worst books collect there is (as you must be aware)
not convertible into the proposition that only bad
books come there, and I see a copy of a certain <cite>Life
of Henry Fawcett</cite> which you may have read. I laze
away my time under verandahs and in gardens&mdash;but
am not wholly inactive. Sometimes when it is cool I
walk some miles and explore country that is well worth
exploration. By the time you come I shall be ready
for an ascent of our central range with you&mdash;it touches
6000 ft. I think, and by that time we shall be having
cooler weather. Yesterday we were breathless: to-day
is cloudy but would be September in England.</p>

<p>It is breakfast time and the porridge is good.</p>

<p>I won't pretend but that I am disappointed by your
decision, the more so because my hopes of your advent
stood higher than Florence's and I had endeavoured to
argue that your half-promise was a valuable security.
However, I know that we are far from England, and
that you are unwilling to leave your household for any
long time. Also the two last boats that have come
here suffered much in the Bay of Biscay and were
very late. So I forgive, though I badly want someone
to walk with. The time has come when I feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
walks are pleasant and do me good, but that I am
very tired of the contents of my own head. But even
a solitary tramp is better than a day in bed, and I am
really grateful to this magnificent climate and to those
who sent me here. To those who cannot speak
Spanish, and I cannot and never shall, the remoter
parts of this island are not very accessible. I sometimes
find myself beset by a troop of boys who take
a fiendish pleasure in dogging the steps of an Englishman
who obviously is deaf, dumb and mad. Attempts
to reason with them only lead to shouts of Penny! or
Tilling!&mdash;I cannot even persuade them that Tilling
is not an English word. Still at times they leave me
in peace and then I can be happy until the next crowd
assembles.</p>

<p>I fear from your last letter that you may take too
seriously what I said in play. No, there was no
promise, only a certain hope that you might come
here, and Reason (with a capital) tells me that your
decision is wise and that you must not give up to
Canarios what was meant for your home and the
<cite>Utilitarians</cite>. I am really glad to think that you are
booking them, and at times I envy you. However
I cannot say that I am unhappy in my idleness.
When I despaired of you for a companion, I took to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
myself the soundest looking man in a hotel full of
invalids, and gat me up into the hills to accomplish
the expedition that I had reserved for you, and we
succeeded in mastering not indeed the highest, but
the most prominent mountain of the island, if a
mountain may be no more than 6000 feet high. This
raised me in my own conceit and certainly I had a
very enjoyable time. I doubt whether in any of your
good ascents you can have seen so gorgeously coloured
a view as that which I beheld. A great part of the
island lay below me; many of the rocks are bright
orange and crimson and these are diversified by
patches of brilliant green; the whole was framed in
the blue of sky and sea. It was like a raised map
that had been over-coloured.</p>

<p>I have been wasting too many of my hours in bed&mdash;and
such hours too&mdash;and have consequently written
few letters. Somehow or another I was chilled in the
course of my voyage: I think it was on board the
little Spanish steamer that brought me here from
Teneriffe: and after a few days, during which I improvidently
cycled to Las Palmas and found that I
had to trudge back, I collapsed. However that episode
I hope is over, and certainly we are in luck this year.
For three weeks the weather has been magnificent; no
drop of rain has fallen and day after day the sun has

<p>I can well believe that England is a gloomy place
just now. Even here where I see few papers and few
English folk, except the family, this ghastly affair sits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
heavily upon me and is always coming between me
and my book: at the moment Gardiners <cite>History</cite>: from
which my thoughts flit off to England and the Transvaal.
It don't make things better to doubt profoundly
whether we have any business to be at war at all. I
remember telling you at Warboys (what a good day
that was!) that I deeply mistrusted Chamberlain.
Since then I have been thinking worse and worse
of him: I hope that I am in the wrong, but only
hope.</p>

<p>... Then I feel a beast for lazing here in the
sunshine among the Spaniards who heartily enjoy all
our misfortunes. And the worst of it is that lazing is
obviously and visibly doing me good. Really and truly
the temptation comes to me, when the sky is at its
bluest, to resign my professorship, realise my small
fortune and become a Canario for the days that remain.
On the other hand three or four projects occasionally
twitch my sleeve&mdash;connected with the Selden Society,
which has behaved more than handsomely by me.
But both sets of motives conspire to keep me lying in
the sun and saying with the Apostles "Lord! it is
good for us to be here."</p>

<p>Well you don't laze. I congratulate you heartily
on coming out at the other end of the <cite>Utilitarians</cite>.
You would not give me the pleasure of proof sheets&mdash;I
regret it, but shall have the whole book soon and
enjoyable it will be. Especially I want to see what
you say of Austin. Since I was here I wrote an article
"Hist. Engl. Law" for the <cite>Encyclop. Britan.</cite> and risked
about Austin a couple of sentences which are not in
accordance with common repute&mdash;and now I feel a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
little frightened. I don't want to be unjust, but I
cannot see exactly where the greatness comes in. So
I am curious to know your judgment about this&mdash;and
many other things. I should like a long talk with you
in these prehistoric surroundings.</p>

<p>My opinions about the origin of this wretched war
are not worth stating and are extremely distressing to
one who holds them. It will be enough to tell you
that this summer John Morley seemed to me the one
English statesman who was keeping his head cool, and
I have not read anything that has changed my mind.
I fear that the whole affair will look bad in history.
And the worst of it is that the cold fit will come with
a vengeance.</p>

<p>We have no good news yet. I hope for some this
afternoon. Your letter came by Marseilles&mdash;to my
surprise, for we rarely get a mail that way. Our last
tidings are of speeches made by generals and these do
not cheer me. Last night I had a talk with a man who
knew the Transvaal and who fears that our volunteer
marksmen will not hit much until they have had two
months of South African atmosphere: the unaccustomed
eye makes wildly incorrect estimates of
distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>You speak of dragoons. "My period," a very short
one 1558-63 is full of the "swart-rutter." The English
government's one idea of carrying on a big war, if war
there was to be, was that of hiring German "swart-rutters."
They did much pistolling, and I suppose
that you know, I don't, how big a machine was the
pistol of those days. Well, the War Office temp.
Mary (only there was not one) was open to criticism.
Every ounce of powder that England had was imported
from the Netherlands. This had to go on for a
while under Elizabeth&mdash;there are amusing letters from
English agents wherein "bales of cloth," and so on,
have an esoteric meaning.</p>

<p>A starved Canarian hound has attached itself to us&mdash;of
the grey-hound type, and sundry small additions
are made to the menagerie as occasion serves. A
parrot died yesterday&mdash;had drunk too much water, so
an expert says&mdash;was called José&mdash;his fellow Juan still
screams. In the neighbouring hotel is another with
atrocious German habits acquired from the head waiter&mdash;will
drink himself drunk with beer and swear terribly.
I hear rumours of an additional monkey whose name
is to be Loango.</p>

<p>I play schoolmaster&mdash;How they have turned the
Latin grammar inside out!&mdash;and I miss my Rule of
Three. In a Spanish Census paper I for once made
myself "doctor iuris": Glasgow allows me to say
"utriusque." I added to the population capable of
reading and writing no less than five names&mdash;for our
trilingual Switzer was to be included&mdash;and this will
seriously affect Canarian statistics.</p>

<p>But I like this illiterate folk.</p>

<p>It is downright wickedly pleasant here. By here
I do not mean in Las Palmas&mdash;which stinketh&mdash;but
some seven miles out of it and some 1300 feet above
it, in a "finca" that we were lucky enough to hire:
that is something between a farm house and a villa.
The Spaniard of the middle class is a town-loving
animal. He likes to have up country a house to which
he can go for six weeks or so in the year and where he
keeps a major domo (= bailiff) who supplies the town
house with country produce. Such a finca we hired
for £1 a week, and there we live very comfortably and
very cheaply among vines and oranges and so forth.
Life here would have been impossible if my wife had
not acquired the Spanish, or rather the Canario, tongue
with wonderful rapidity. I fancy that some of her
language is strong; but if you want anything here you
must shout.</p>

<p>I am right glad to hear that it is no worse with
you. But just you be careful about cold. I know it
is the worst enemy that I have, and I suspect that you
will find the same. I have often wondered how you
contrived to live in "a thorough draught." The time
comes when one cannot do it, and that time came to
me early. In the sunshine I begin to make some flesh,
the wind no longer whistles through my ribs and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
have not had ache or pain these two months. (Interval
during which the writer gets himself out of the aforesaid
sunshine which to-day has an African quality.) I
wish you could be here, but wonder whether you could
be demoralized; some demoralization would do you
good, but I cannot imagine you as lazy as I am. Still
you might try. And really though I am lazy I have
managed to do some things that I should not have
done at home and hope to have something to offer the
Press when I return. The subject of my meditations
is the damnability of corporations. I rather think that
they must be damned: the Chartered for example.</p>

<p>News as you suppose comes here fitfully. Sometimes
a telegram reaches Las Palmas, and occasionally
it is not contradicted. But in the main we depend
upon newspapers. I feel somewhat of a beast for
being outside all this war trouble, more especially as I
went abroad with a very low opinion of the Government's
South African policy. That opinion I should
like to change but I cannot. Your amateur strategist
must be pretty intolerable. I have met a few people
here who knew something of the Transvaal and they
have none of them been cheerful. The puzzle to me
"after the event" is why more was not known in
Downing Street. I can't help fearing that when all
comes out the whole affair will look very bad....</p>

<p>It will be a very strange book that <cite>History</cite> of
ours<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. I am extremely curious to see whether Acton
will be able to maintain a decent amount of harmony
among the chapters. Some chapters that I saw did
not look much like parts of one and the same book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Before I went off I put my chapter into his lordship's
hands. I never was more relieved than when I got
rid of it. His lordship's lordship was considerate to
an invalid and only excepted to a few new words that
I had made, but I daresay he swore&mdash;if he ever swears&mdash;in
private.... I never knew time run as it runs here.
Soon I shall have to be thinking of my return with the
mixedest feelings. I am going to give Cambridge
a last chance. If it cannot keep me at about 9 stone,
I shall "realise" such patrimony as I have and buy a
finca. Then for the great treatise De Damnabilitate
Universitatis.</p>

<p>It was very good of you to give me a piece of your
New Year's Eve and to tell me much that I wanted to
know. For my part I am practising the art of writing
while lying flat on my back and am flattering myself
that I make some progress, though the management of
a pipe complicates the matter. The result of lying
abed is that I am getting through much too quickly
the small store of books that I brought with me and
am falling back on the resources of the one bookshop
that the island contains. If this sort of thing goes on
I shall be driven to Spanish translations of Zola. I
have just finished Feuillet's <cite>La Muerta</cite>&mdash;but then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
I knew the French original. After what you say I
must see whether Erckmann-Chatrian has been done
into Spanish. In a list that I have before me I see
Dickens down for "Dias penosos" and some Wilkie
Collins&mdash;but apparently the novel-reading Spaniard
lives for the most part on Frenchmen, especially Zola.
I shall never talk Spanish. I believe that what is or
used to be called a classical education makes many
cowards: the dread of "howlers" keeps me silent
when I ought to plunge regardless of consequences.</p>

<p>I fancy that the comparison that you instituted
between the life of the Roman and the life of the
Spaniard as seen by me in these islands might be
extended to a good many particulars. When, as
happens for about eleven months in the year, you
are not living at your finca, you occasionally pay it
visits with a party of friends&mdash;male friends only&mdash;whom
you entertain there. You eat a great deal and
drink until you are merry&mdash;then late in the evening you
drive back to town twanging a guitar, and, if you can,
you sing inane verses made impromptu. Our landlord
had one of these carouses the day before he handed
over the house to us, and my wife's account of the
state in which the house was when she entered and set
some servants to scrub it is not for publication.... Is
not this rather classical?</p>

<p>Also I wonder what has gone wrong with the
mails&mdash;we might be at the other end of the earth, so
slow is news to reach us. A rumour came up yesterday
from the ciudad which makes me reflect that I don't
know for certain whether you have a queen in England
or a king. And I can't go and see how all this is, for
if I leave my bed, I am soon sent back there again by
this blameworthy neuralgia which threatens to become
what Glanvill calls morbus reseantisae. Et sic iaceo
discinctus discalciatus et sine braccis ut patuit militibus
comitatus qui missi fuerunt ad me videndum et qui
michi dederunt diem apud Turrim Lundoniae in

<p>So I make some progress through Spanish novels&mdash;or
rather novels that have been translated into Spanish.
At present I am in <cite>Resurreccion</cite> by the Conde Leon
Tolstoy&mdash;which is easy. I find Perez Galdos a little
too hard for my recumbent position, and dictionaries
are bad bed-fellows. I have been indolently making
for subsequent use a sort of Year Book grammar. I
have got a pretty complete être and avoir&mdash;and really
I think that the lawyers had a fair command of all the
tenses&mdash;I have seen some well sustained subjunctives.</p>

<p>You spoke of Maine. Well, I always talk of him
with reluctance, for on the few occasions on which
I sought to verify his statements of fact I came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
conclusion that he trusted much to a memory that
played him tricks and rarely looked back at a book
that he had once read: e.g. his story about the position
of the half-blood in the Law of Normandy seems to
me a mere dream that is contradicted by every version
of the custumal.</p>

<p>By the way, when you discoursed of the term
"comparative Jurisprudence," had you noticed that
Austin used it? I was surprised by seeing it in his
book the other day. Burgenses de Cantebrige dederunt
michi libertatem burgi sui honoris causa quia edidi

<p>Here I am lying in the sun which shines as if it
were June and not December. This year our "finca"
is in the midst of a "pueblo." The front of our house
faces a high street which is none too clean&mdash;but then
you keep the front of your house so shut up that you
see nothing of the street and at the back all is orange
and coffee and banana and so forth. Telde is the
centre of an important trade in tomatos&mdash;the whole
village is employed in the work of packing them for
the English market and sending them off to the
shops in Las Palmas. Really it has become a very
big industry in these last years and if English people
gave up eating tomatos, hundreds of Canarios would
be in a bad way. But there! You don't want to hear
of foreign parts, and if we could meet our talk would
be of Cambridge....</p>

<p>I was glad of your letter. I had been in a poor
way and it cheered me. Now I am doing well and
ride a bit on my cycle along one of the three roads
of the island. I thought that you would like <cite>Joh.
Althusius</cite> if you could penetrate the shell<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. I like all
that man's books, and his history of things in general
as seen from the point of view of a student of corporations
is full of good stuff, besides being to all
appearance appallingly learned. I rather fancy that
Hobbes's political feat consisted in giving a new twist
to some well worn theories of the juristic order and
then inventing a psychology which would justify that
twist. I shall be very much interested to hear what
you have to say about the old gentleman. A many
years ago I saw in the Museum a copy of the <cite>Leviathan</cite>
with a note telling how the wretched old atheist was
buried head downwards or face downwards or something
of the sort in a garden&mdash;a nice little legend in
the making!</p>

<p>Have you read <cite>De Mirabilibus Pecci</cite>? Stevenson
the Anglo-Saxon scholar, who travelled outwards with
me, told me that the first recorded appearance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
name of the Peak (something like Pecesus) shows that
the great cavern was called after the Devil's hinder
parts. Did Hobbes know that? What a thing it is
to be a philologer!</p>

<p>Let me wish you a happy new year and then ask
for a line in return. It doesn't follow in law or in fact
that because I have nothing to say that you care to
hear therefore you have nothing to say that I care to
hear. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>Why did you make my life miserable by suggesting
that grammar does not allow me to wish you a happy
new year and does not allow you to send me a letter?
I consulted a professed grammarian who told me
that "me" and "you" are good datives and "to" in
such cases an unnecessary and historically unjustifiable
preposition. Go on like this and you will end where
the Spaniard is, and he loves "to" his parents, etc.
When we still have to contend with relics of a subjunctive
you need not be making more difficulties.
I am led into these exceedingly uninteresting remarks
by the nature of my only pursuit. I had a bad time
on the voyage. Something went wrong with my works
and since I have been here I have not had much
choice between lying almost flat and suffering a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
deal of pain. So I have been copying Year Books
from the manuscripts that I brought from Cambridge
and since the scribes did not finish their words and I
have to supply the endings I have been compelled to
take a serious interest in old French Grammar. However,
things are improving. I had ten minutes on the
cycle yesterday and hope soon to see a little of the
country. We are in a village this year. It is the
centre of the trade in tomatos. Boxes of tomatos with
the Telde mark have been seen even in the Cambridge
market place. As I lie here I am surrounded by
oranges, coffee, bananas, etc., and we have even a
true dragon tree. It is wonderfully beautiful. Florence
and the children are exceedingly happy and I am
beginning to doubt whether I shall get them back
to Cambridge when the Spring comes. You would
think that Florence had never talked anything but
Spanish. Not that I would warrant its Castilian
quality, but at any rate it is rapid and highly effectual.</p>

<p>I am sorry indeed that the part of your letter to
which I looked anxiously contained such bad news&mdash;and
having said that I think that I won't say more&mdash;it
is so useless.</p>

<p>The Spaniard ends his letter with S.S.S.Q.B.S.M.
and I understand this to mean su seguro servidor que<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
besa sus manos&mdash;but he puts it in even when he writes
to the papers and there is no thought of any real
kissing in the case. I send you two little bits of
English for (!) decipherment. They appear day by
day and month by month in the <cite>Diario de Las Palmas</cite>
and I hope that they are intelligible to its non-English
readers. The said newspaper is one of some half
dozen daily rags published in our "ciudad"&mdash;I am
surprised by their number. They seem largely to live
upon ancient English papers&mdash;I mean papers which
have taken a week to get here and have then been
lying about in the hotels for another week or more.
Hence queer snips from <cite>Tit Bits</cite>, etc.</p>

<p>Which makes me think of Acton. (His professed
admiration of <cite>Tit Bits</cite> has some basis in fact: at least
I once entered a railway carriage and found him deep
in said paper.) What a prodigious catechism he addressed
to you! I should like to have seen your

strong. I hear that I am to serve on the Press Syndicate:
I doubt I shall do much good there&mdash;still I am
quite willing to hear others talk and shall be interested
in all that concerns the big book.</p>

<p>These last weeks I have been doing splendidly and
have got through a spell of copying which would never
have been done had I stayed in England&mdash;as you say,
life in Cambridge is an interruption. Buckland is a
good companion and I think that we have taken our
cycles where cycles have not been before&mdash;a crowd of

<p>I returned yesterday from a winter spent in the
Canaries where I am compelled to take refuge. Already
I have read your article about gifts for non-charitable
purposes and have been delighted by it. It puts an
accent on what I think a matter of great historical
importance&mdash;namely the extreme liberality of our law
about charitable trusts. It seems to me that our people
slid unconsciously from the enforcement of the rights
of a c.q.t. to the establishment of trusts without a c.q.t.&mdash;the
so-called charitable trusts: and I think that continental
law shows that this was a step that would not
and could not be taken by men whose heads were full
of Roman Law. <em>Practically</em> the private man who
creates a charitable trust does something that is very
like the creation of an artificial person, and does it
without asking leave of the State.</p>

<p>No I had nothing to write of Acton. A few
memorable talks on Sunday afternoons were all I had.
To my great regret I did not hear the first of the
Eranus papers.... What the literary Nachlass is like I
cannot tell and am not likely to know. I saw the notes
for an introductory chapter<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> confided to Figgis. They
seemed to me to be quite useless in the hands of anyone
save him who made them. They struck me as
very sad: the notes of a man who could not bring to
the birth the multitude of thoughts that were crowding
in his mind.</p>

<p>Have you seen Sidgwick's small book on philosophy?
I think it in some respects the most Sidgwickian thing
that is in print. I can hear most of it&mdash;some of it
from the hearth-rug or at the Eranus.</p>

<p>I think that the K.C.B. came to Stephen just at
the right moment and that he is really pleased by it.
About his condition I don't know the exact truth.
The good thing is that there is little discomfort. He
is writing Ford Lectures for Oxford, but says that he
will not be able to deliver them. Have you seen in
his <cite>George Eliot</cite> the remark about Edmund Gurney?
"I have always fancied&mdash;though without any evidence,
that some touches in Deronda were drawn from one

charm of character and as good-looking as Deronda"

<p>From an exercise on the use of the subjunctive.
Beyond this point my Spanish will not carry me.
Compulsory Greek, acting on a fine natural stupidity,
deprived me early of all power of learning languages.
I envy my children who chatter to the servants in
what is good enough Canario, though I doubt it being
Castilian. My voyage was abominable. I am driven
into the second class. I like second class <em>men</em> (not
women): they are often very interesting people who
have seen odd things and been in strange places&mdash;but
a cabin close to the screw is bad and sleep was out of
the question. Two lines of F. Myers (have I got
them rightly) got into my head and set themselves
to the accompanying noises:&mdash;"doubting if any recompense
hereafter waits to atone the intolerable wrong?"
But this was faithlessness&mdash;it is all atoned by a few
hours of this glorious sunshine. Already I am regenerate
and a new man.... Do you know Paul Bourget's
<cite>L'Étape</cite>? It is not great but it served to kill some
bad hours. And do you know Huysman? He looks
to me like a debauchee who has turned himself into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
ritualistic curate and is very sweet upon his highly
artificial style. I am now tackling <cite>Gil Blas</cite> in the
classical Spanish translation which some say is better
than the original.</p>

<p>Your letter about Paris is to hand. Well I envy
you. Yours are the joys that I should have liked if I
had my choice&mdash;but I must not complain, for I am
having a superlatively good time. I don't exactly
know why it is but the sun makes all the difference to
me&mdash;I live here and don't live in England. I am even
beginning to boast of my powers as a hill rider: but if
ever I come here again I shall bring a machine with a
very low gear and a free wheel: that is what you want
if you live half way up a road that rises pretty steadily
for 21 kilometres to 2600 feet. My friend Bennett
who has vast experience recommends a gear of 50 for
such work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I push on with the Year Books. My
first volume is done in the rough and a good piece is
in print. Being away from books I become intrigued
in small verbal problems. Am now observing the
liberal use of the verb <i lang="fr">lier</i>. In French you (an
advocate) are said to <i lang="fr">lier</i> the seisin, or the esplees, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the like, in this person or that. When translating I
naturally write "lay," and I have a suspicion that the
"to lay" of our legal vocabulary (e.g. to lay these
damages) really descends from lier&mdash;que piensa V<sup>d</sup>?
That is the sort of triviality that occupies my mind:&mdash;however
I am meditating a final say about the personality
of states and corporations. Why not bring over
Salmond to succeed you at Oxford? He is a good
man. Local politics are interesting. I think that
when Gladstone was in power he never was subjected
to such continuous assaults as are directed against the
Alcalde of Las Palmas by the organ of opinion that I
patronize. Drought and flood, mud and dust, smallpox
and measles are all from him, he fills the butchers'
shops with large blue flies. But I should like to hear
the lectures that you make for los Yanquis (N.B. in a
Spanish mouth Americano is apt to mean a Spanish
speaking man&mdash;and Yanqui is not uncivilly meant).</p>

<p>Much rain has fallen&mdash;but a road recovers from
the most appalling mud in a very few hours.</p>

<p>The news that we get of you out here is satisfactory
rather than satisfying&mdash;I mean that we have
heard little, but it was all to the good. The last
intelligence takes you back to your home and I feel
good reason for hoping that long before now you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
become reasonably comfortable. What I wish you
know.</p>

<p>All here goes well. I am having a supremely good
time&mdash;the only pains are those given by my conscience
or by the voice that exists where my conscience should
be&mdash;but the remedies for moral twinges are not difficult
to come by in this world of sin&mdash;which also is (locally)
a world of corrupting sunshine.</p>

<p>I brought with me this time all the three supplementary
volumes of <cite>Dict. Natl. Biog.</cite> I stare at them
and wonder how anybody can have the energy to make
such things. Even novels strike me as laborious
productions when the sun is at its best.</p>

<p>We have been having rain: and when it rains here
you find that the roof of your house has been surprised
by the performance. I am now engaged in drying a
boxful of copied Year Book which unfortunately was
left beneath a weak point in the ceiling. Is it "ceiling"
by the way? I don't know, and while I am in the
garden the dictionary is in the house and I don't care
a perrita (primarily little bitch but also a five centimo
piece) how this or any other word spells itself; and all
this I ascribe to the sun.</p>

<p>It will be a good day when I get a postcard signed

<p>We have been having bad news of sorts from home
and this has spoilt what would otherwise have been a
pleasant time, for though we have had heavy rain&mdash;even
snow on the hill tops&mdash;we keep a really working
sun that is up to a sun's business and converts the
most appalling mud into dust in the space of a few
hours. Until just lately I have been wondrous well.
My amusement I have taken in the shape of lessons in
Spanish from the hostess of the village inn. She
prides herself on not talking like the other folk of
Tafira&mdash;but asked me whether Perez Galdos wrote <cite>Gil
Blas</cite>. P. G. is by birth a Canario and mighty proud
they are of him here. Every little town has a street
named after him. To my mind he is a most unequal
storyteller&mdash;sometimes very good, at others dull.</p>

<p>Until just this week I have been doing wonderfully
well. Now the messenger of Satan has returned to
buffet me and abate my pride. So the cycle has to
rest; but I am hopeful that the visitation may be
short&mdash;it ought to be if the climate has anything to
do with the matter, for after some rainy weeks we are
on the sun again. El Señor Cura "clapped in the
prayer for rain" so very effectually that he had to
protest before all saints that he had not meant quite
so much as all that. Rainmaking is still one of the
chief duties of the priesthood in such a country as

<p>The proposal made by "the minister" and mentioned

were seven or eight good causes for the refusal&mdash;all of
which will at once occur to your l'dship except perhaps
one which I will tell you. My present place has been
made extremely easy to me by the very great kindness
of such colleagues as it has happened to few to have.
Even if I had been a historian and an able-bodied
man I should have thought many times before I
changed my estate.&mdash;And what you say of the crowd
at Bury's first lecture&mdash;I thought the appointment very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>good&mdash;confirms my view. The Regius Professor of
Modern History is expected to speak to the world at
large and even if I had anything to say to the W.
at L. I don't think that I should like full houses and
the limelight. So I go back to the Year Books.
Really they are astonishing. I copy and translate for
some hours every day and shall only have scratched
the surface if I live to the age of Methusalem&mdash;but if I
last a year or two longer I shall be a "dab" at real
actions. It was a wonderful game as intricate as chess
and not like chess cosmopolitan. Unravelling it is an
amusement not unlike that of turning the insides out
of ancient comedies I guess.</p>

<p>Mientras las primeras semanas de mia estancia en

muchas veces y se ha visto nieve en las cumbres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Los barrancos fueron llenos de agua y le agua se
introdujó por el tejado de nuestra casa. El fango me
recordaba el viaje que hicimos en Marzo de Galdar
á Telde. No mé gustaba el frio y no estoy tan bién
que estaba hace poco tiempo. Mi antiguo enemigo
me amenaza pero espero que le venceré. De consiguiente
no he ido á Telde; pero espero ir luego, y
si fuere buscaré á Santiago su criado de V<sup>d</sup> y le daré
el duro que mi dió para él. La viruela todavia se
enfurece en Telde y en las Palmas tambien.</p>

<p>Todos sus amigos de V<sup>d</sup> estan muy bien pero un

<p>Quiero leer el libro de Sen. X aunque no sé si le

<p>I should like to take this opportunity of asking
you a question which you will be able to answer very
easily. In 1862 our Parliament made it possible for
any seven or more persons associated for any lawful
purpose to form themselves into a corporation. But
this provision was accompanied by a prohibition. For
the future the formation of large partnerships (of more
than 20 persons) was forbidden. In effect the legislature
said that every big association having for its object
the acquisition of gain must be a corporation. Thereby
the formation of "unincorporated joint stock companies"
was stopped. I may say in passing that now-a-days
few Englishmen are aware of the existence of this
prohibitory law because the corporate form has proved
itself to be very much more convenient than the unincorporate.
Now what I should like to know is
whether when in your States the time came for general
corporation laws there was any parallel legislation
against unincorporated companies. I have some of
your American books on Corporations and I gather
from them that the repressive or prohibitory side of
our Companies Act is not represented among you.
But am I right in drawing this inference, and (if so)
should I also be right in supposing that you would
see constitutional objections to such a rule as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
which I am speaking: i.e. a rule prohibiting the formation
of large partnerships or unincorporated joint-stock
companies? A friend in New York supplied me
with some very interesting trust deeds which in effect
seemed to create companies of this sort. Should I
then be right in supposing that in the U.S.A. the
unincorporate company lived on beside the new trading
corporation?</p>

<p>I am endeavouring to explain in a German journal
how our law (or equity) of trusts enabled us to keep
alive "unincorporate bodies" which elsewhere must
have perished. Of course I must not speak of
America. Still I should like to know in a general
way whether the development of the "unincorporated
company" which we repressed in 1862 was similarly
repressed in the States, and a word or two from you
about this matter would be most thankfully received.</p>

<p>By the way&mdash;and here I enter your own particular
close&mdash;I observed that those New York deeds were
careful to confine the trust within the limits of the
perpetuity rule. Is it settled American law that this
is necessary? We explain our <em>clubs</em> by saying that
as the whole equitable ownership is vested in the
original members there can be no talk of perpetuity&mdash;and
I believe that there are some extremely important
unincorporated companies with transferable shares
(formed before 1862&mdash;in particular the London Stock
Exchange) which are built up on this theory: the
theory is that the original shareholders were in equity
absolute masters of the land, buildings, etc. Does
that commend itself to you?</p>

<p>There! you see what comes of writing to me! A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
whole catechism! Please think no more of it unless
a very few words would set my feet in the straight
road.</p>

<p>Most of my time is being given to the Year Books.
The first volume is with the binder.</p>

<p>I often look back with great pleasure to the few
hours that you and Mrs Gray spent with us in
Gloucestershire. Would that I could see you again,
but all my journeys have to be to the Canaries.</p>

<p>Your very kind letter of the 4th is exactly what
I wanted. But surely there is nothing "odd" in my
asking you questions which you of living men can
answer best. It would be odd if I went elsewhere.</p>

<p>The brief in Howe <em>v.</em> Morse is extremely interesting.
I think that an English Court would take your
view in such a case, but when it comes to questions
about legacies our judges sometimes <em>say</em> things which
stray from the path of rectitude as drawn by Prof.
Gray.</p>

<p>I have been trying all this summer to finish an
essay designed to explain to Germans the nature of
a trust, and especially the manner in which the trust
enabled us to keep alive all sorts of "bodies" which
were not technically corporate. I am obliged now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
flee to the Canaries leaving this unfinished, for a particularly
fraudulent summer has made me very useless.
Some one ought to explain our trust to the world at
large, for I am inclined to think that the construction
thereof is the greatest feat that men of our race have
performed in the field of jurisprudence. Whether I
shall be able to do this remains to be seen&mdash;but it
ought to be done.</p>

<p>I fear that I must not carry my good wishes beyond
the point of hoping that the improvement that I saw
last time I visited you has gone further and that at
any rate you are easy and free from pain. I have just
had a week in this island. Part of it I spent foolishly
in bed but now I am in a delightful atmosphere and
have been thoroughly enjoying your Hobbes. It is
worthy of you, and you know what I mean when I
say that. I have been all through it once and have
corrected most of the typists errors. A few little
points must stand over until I can command the
whole of the "Works" (I only brought two volumes
with me) but they are not of such a kind as would
prevent the copy going to the printers, and I propose
to send it to them very soon, for they will let me keep
the stuff in type until I am again in England. The
difficulties to which I refer are words occurring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
your quotations from Hobbes&mdash;just here and there
your writing beats me, but a few minutes with Molesworth
will settle the matter....</p>

<p>I think I told you that in my estimate you have
written, more rather than less, your due tale of words.
I shall add nothing save some tag which will serve as
a substitute for the missing end of the final paragraph
(said tag I may be able to submit to you) and I shall
omit nothing save trifles unless the publishers insist.</p>

<p>I have been speculating as to what T. H. would
have said had he lived until 1688. If it becomes clear
that your "sovereign" is going to acknowledge the
pope's claims, this of course is no breach of any contract
between ruler and ruled (for there is no such
contract) but is there not an abdication? Putting
theory out of the question, which would the old
gentleman have disliked most, Revolution against
Leviathan, or a Leviathan with the Roman fisherman's
hook in his nose?</p>

<p>Well he was a delightful old person and deserved
the expositor whom he has found.</p>

<p>This may&mdash;I cannot be sure that it will&mdash;be in
time to salute you on Christmas day. Posts are

<p>I had the good luck to find the Bay of Biscay
reflecting a really warm sun and very soon I could
hardly believe that so grey a place as Cambridge
existed. I arrived here at the end of a prolonged
drought and the good folk of Telde "clapped on the
prayer for rain": or rather they did much more; they
carried round the town a milagroso Cristo whom they
keep for great occasions. I am not sure that the priest
let him go his rounds until he, the priest, saw that the
clouds were collecting thick over the mountains. Anyhow
the rain came at once, to the great edification
of the faithful. Since then we have celebrated the
Immaculate Conception. It is very queer how events
get turned into persons. The Conception became a
person for the people. I think that the historian of
myths would learn a good deal here. Just lately I
discovered&mdash;it was no great discovery&mdash;that the pet
name "Concha" is the short for Concepcion, as Lola
is the short for Dolores. My protestant mind has
been a little shocked by a female form of Jesus,
namely "Jesusa."</p>

<p>I am living in hope that Pollock's successor at
Oxford may be Vinogradoff. I wish much that we
had him at Cambridge.</p>

<p>I am curious to hear any news that there may be
concerning the deliberations of the great syndicate.
I suppose that something will be known before I
return to Cambridge&mdash;if ever I return. I say "if
ever" for I am always thinking of resignation. Out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
here I can do a great deal with photographed manuscripts
and so on, whereas in England I get nothing
done.</p>

<p>You I suppose are deep in "Josephism"&mdash;by the
way has anybody endeavoured to transfer that term
from a manner of treating the church to Mr C.'s fiscal
policy? My latest newspaper gives the Duke's oration&mdash;how
very good our Chancellor can be!&mdash;but no doubt
that is with you a very ancient history<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. My own impression

<p>No, you draw a wrong inference from my silence.
When I am hurt I cry. When I am not crying I am
happy. In this instance I have been very happy
indeed and so busy that I have taken six weeks over
a novel, and am once more developing a corn on my
little finger by copying.... All that you tell me of the

<p>Writing those initials made me think of your
Eranus. I wish that I had heard you. I think that
I might have been able to add an ancient story or
two. I think that I once told you how the "to wit"
placed after the name of a county at the beginning of
a legal record (e.g. Cambridgeshire, to wit, A.B. complains
that C. D. etc.) represents a mere flourish ʃ
dividing the name of the county from the beginning
of the story. This was mistaken for a long S which
was supposed to be the abbreviation of scilicet. The
Spaniards are fond of using mere initials: after a dead
person's name you can put q.d.h.e.g. = que Dios haya
en gloria. The case that amuses me most is that you
can speak of the Host as S.D.M. (his divine majesty&mdash;just
like H.R.H.). One day in Las Palmas I had to
spring from my bicycle and kneel in the road because
S.D.M. was coming along. But I have just had my
revenge. I have been mistaken for S.D.M. They
ring a little bell in front of him. I rarely ring my
bicycle bell because I don't think it a civil thing to do
in a land where cycles are very rare. However the
other day I was almost upon the backs of two men, so
I rang. They started round and at the same time
instinctively raised their hats&mdash;and instead of S.D.M.
there was only an <i lang="es">hereje</i>.</p>

<p>To be sure those letters of Acton's are thrilling.
I saw them out here last year. Mrs Drew wanted
me to edit them. I declined the task, after talking to
Leslie Stephen. Obviously I was not the right man.
I am boundlessly ignorant of contemporary history
and could not in the least tell what would give undeserved
and unnecessary pain. On the other hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
I should think that H. Paul was the right man for

foresee that I shall be slated in all quarters. Acton
was an adroit flatterer and induced me to put my hand

<p>It is good to see your hand and kind of you to
write to me, especially as I fear that writing is not
so easy to you as it once was. I do very earnestly
hope that things go fairly well with you and that you
have not much pain. Yesterday I was thinking a lot
of your courage and my cowardice for I took an off

an altitude of (say) 5250 feet (a cog-wheel railway

Get on a sledge and wiss (or is it wiz?) you go down

<p>I have your second letter, not your first. The first
may be lying in the Hotel at Las Palmas and I must
attempt to get it. This year it is difficult to communicate
with the "ciudad" for there has been a prolonged
drought and the roads&mdash;but did you ever try cycling
across a ploughed field? Moreover people here are
lazy and casual and the semi-hispanised English people
who keep the English hotels are perhaps more casual
than the true Jack Spaniards. Well, I must get that
letter, for which I thank in advance, even if it costs
me a day's labour and some strong language. Meanwhile
I will talk of canary birds. The birds are named
after our islands. What our islands are named after,
nobody, so I am told, knows for certain. Whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
birds are found wild in all the seven islands I don't
know. Certainly there are many in Gran Canaria.
Also there are many in Madeira. The wild canary is,
I believe, always a dusky little chap, brown and green.
The sulphur coloured or canary-coloured canary is, I am
told, a work of art, and I have heard say that he was
made at Norwich: by "made" of course I mean bred
by human selection. The most highly priced canaries
are, I believe, made in Germany. I have known two
guineas asked for a "Hartz Mountain Canary": it
sang <em>pp.</em> like a very sweet musical box. On the other
hand, wild canaries are cheap here, especially if you go
up country and buy of the boys who catch them. My
wife quotes as a fair range of price half a peseta to a
peseta and a half. The peseta ought to be equivalent
to the franc but is much depreciated. So let us say
that a bird can be had for a shilling. My wife adds
that she would be very happy to import birds for your
daughter&mdash;and this is not a civil phrase but gospel
truth: she is never happier than when she is acquiring
pets as principal or agent:&mdash;so it is, and I can't help it.
I like the song of these dusky birds: it is not nearly
so piercing as that of the Norwich variety. I daresay
that I have told you some untruths in this ornithological
excursus&mdash;but at any rate I make no mistake about the
price of wild birds or about my wife's willingness&mdash;I
might say eagerness&mdash;to transact business.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI.</a></h2>


<p>One of the principal subjects which engaged
Maitland's mind during these years was the history
of the Corporation. Problems connected with the
growth and definition of the Corporate idea had furnished
the theme of the Ford Lectures and a course
upon the Corporation in English law was delivered
in Cambridge in the Autumn Term of 1899. It was
a subject from which Maitland derived deep and
peculiar delight. It brought into play the full range
of his faculties, for it was at once metaphysical, legal
and historical. It was associated with the enquiries
which he had already been making into municipal
origins, and into the law of the medieval Church, while,
at the same time, it was connected with some living
and familiar developments of modern law, with those
corporate groups which, during the later half of the
nineteenth century "had been multiplying all the world
over at a rate far outstripping the increase of natural
persons." Trades unions and joint-stock companies,
chartered boroughs and medieval universities, village
communities and townships, merchant guilds and crafts,
every form of association known to medieval or modern
life came within his view, as illustrating the way in
which Englishmen attempted "to distinguish and reconcile
the manyness of the members and the oneness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of the body." An enquiry of this kind was something
entirely new in England. Here lawyers had accepted
from the Canonists the view that the Corporation was
a fiction of the law created by the authoritative act of
the State. A mindless thing, "incapable of knowing,
intending, willing, acting, distinct from the living corporators
who are called its members," the Corporation
is and must be the creature of the State. "Into its
nostrils the State must breathe the breath of fictitious
life, for otherwise it would be no animated body but
individualistic dust." <i lang="la">Solus princeps fingit quod in
rei veritate non est.</i> Such a theory was, as Maitland
pointed out, likely to play into the hands of the
paternal despot. The Corporation so conceived&mdash;and
this is how not only Savigny but Blackstone also conceived
it&mdash;was no subject for liberties and franchises
and rights of self-government. It was but "a wheel
in the State machinery." And yet in England, where
the Concession theory of the Corporation was received
without challenge, there had certainly not been less of
autonomy and free grouping in guilds and fellowships
than elsewhere. The secret of this apparent contradiction,
between a theory which made corporateness
the creature of a sovereign authority and a practice
which enabled permanent groups to be freely formed
without such authority, was to be found in a legal
conception peculiar to England, the conception of the
Trust. "Behind the screen of trustees and concealed
from the direct scrutiny of legal theories, all manner
of groups can flourish: Lincoln's Inn, or Lloyds, or
the Stock Exchange, or the Jockey Club, a whole
presbyterian system or even the Church of Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
with the Pope at its head...." Even a large company,
trading with a joint-stock with vendible shares and
a handsome measure of "limited liability," could be
constructed by means of a trust deed without any
incorporation. Aided by this "loose trust-concept,"
under the shelter of which organic groups of the most
various kinds could live and prosper, English lawyers
were not vitally concerned with the theory of the
Corporation. The law of the Corporation was only
one part, and probably not the most important part, of
the English fellowship-law, but in Germany, where
no such convenient shelter had been provided for
the "unincorporate body," the case was different, and
active discussion had raged round the nature of the
Corporation. The fiction theory invented by Sinibald
Fieschi, who became Pope Innocent IV in 1243, and
developed and expounded by Savigny, had proved
itself inadequate in an age of joint-stock companies
and railway collisions; and in the rising tide of German
nationalism men were prone to question the validity of
a conception derived from the alien jurisprudence of
Rome. A new school of thinkers arose preaching the
theory of the Genossenschaft or Fellowship. They
held that the German Fellowship was neither fictitious
nor State-made, that it was "a living organism, and a
real person with body and members and will of its
own," a group-person with a group-will. The most
important representative of this new school of German
realists was Dr Gierke, whose work Maitland introduced
to the British public after his first winter exile
in Grand Canary.</p>

<p>Maitland had followed with unflagging interest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
steady enthusiasm the great outburst of legal literature
in Germany which preceded the construction of the
German Civil Code. Of the Code itself he wrote that
"it was the most carefully considered statement of a
nation's law that the world has ever seen"; while
he found in the legal debate of the Germanist and
Romanist schools work which sometimes showed "a
delicacy of touch and a subtlety of historical perception,"
of which Englishmen, "having no pressing
need for comparison," could know little. For the
purpose which Maitland had in view, the explanation
of the way in which Englishmen had conceived of
group life in its various embodiments, this subtle and
delicate treatment of the forms of legal thought, this
"ideal morphology" of the Germans, was no less full
of suggestion than the ample historical science with
which it was supported. It provided tests, and suggested
those points of analogy and contrast between
English and German development, which give to
Maitland's treatment of the Corporate and Unincorporate
Body the quality of an original discourse upon
the legal and political theory of Western Europe.</p>

<p>Nor was the interest of the subject merely speculative.
Maitland was a practical lawyer with a genius
for detecting the source of bad law and bad administration
in confused modes of thinking about ultimate
questions. Looking for the moment at the English
law concerning Corporations through the spectacles of
a German realist, he detected as the principal offence
against jurisprudence "a certain half-heartedness in
our treatment of unincorporate groups." We were
unwilling to recognise trades-unions for example as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
persons, while we made fairly adequate provision for
their continuous life. The consequence of this half-heartedness
was felt in the domain of public administration
as well as in the domain of private law.
Englishmen had accepted "a bad and foreign theory,
which coupling corporateness with princely privilege
refused to recognise and call forth into vigour the
bodiliness that was immanent in every township."
The Americans had been less pedantic and had permitted
the New England town to develop its inherent
corporateness. We, on the contrary, influenced by the
Concession theory of the Corporation, had shrunk
from declaring the village to be a legal person, the
subject of rights and the object of gifts. The consequences
of this fatal blunder were not measurable
merely in terms of administrative symmetry; but so
measured they were very great. No one knew better
than Maitland the "appalling mess" of English local
government. He had described its broader features
in <cite>Justice and Police</cite>; he analysed certain underlying
sources of confusion in <cite>Township and Borough</cite>. In
his Introduction to Gierke's <cite>Political Theories of the
Middle Ages</cite> he was disposed to ascribe no small part
of this confusion to the timidity "tardily redressed by
the invention of Parish Councils" which had stood
between the English village and legal personality.</p>

<p>Other defects of loose and imperfect thinking upon
the Corporation were pointed out to the readers of the
<cite>Law Quarterly Review</cite> in the articles entitled the
"Corporation Sole and the Crown as Corporation."
The American State has private rights; it has power
to sue: English law, on the other hand, had never yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
formally admitted that the Corporate realm, besides being
the wielder of public power, might also be the subject
of private rights, the owner of lands and chattels. Our
habit is to speak of the Sovereign as a corporation sole,
and to refuse to recognise him as the head of a complex
and highly organised "corporation aggregate of many."
Such modes of thought, however well they may have
fitted the designs of Tudor despotism, were neither
appropriate to the needs of a free community nor
adjusted to the conditions of modern life. The talk
about "Kings who do not die, who are never under
age, who are ubiquitous, who do no wrong and think
no wrong" had "not been innocuous"; and other
practical inconveniences were involved in the identification
of the Common-wealth with the person of the
Sovereign and in the failure to discriminate between
the natural and official aspects of the Sovereign's personality.
Special legislation, for instance, had been
required to secure private estates for Kings. For these
insular peculiarities there were, of course, assignable
historical reasons, and one of these reasons, which
Maitland was the first to suggest, is certainly very
curious. The idea of treating the King of England as
a corporation sole had occurred to Coke, or some other
lawyer of Coke's day, because the parson had already
been treated as a corporation sole. Why, when and
how the parson came so to be treated furnishes matter
for a very pretty piece of historical investigation. Who
would have imagined that an unfortunate analogy,
striking across the mind of a Tudor lawyer, would
have helped to give to the legal aspect of the English
State a peculiar colour&mdash;a colour different from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
which it has received, for instance, in America. Without
a superb knowledge of the Year Books, who could
have fixed the offence upon Richard Broke or upon
one of Richard Broke's contemporaries? And how
many men, having mastered the recondite knowledge
of the Year Books, would have retained a sense of the
large perspectives of history sufficiently strong and
vivid as to apprehend the successive legal and political
forces which gave support to a "juristic abortion"
through three and a half centuries of national life?</p>

<p>Apart from their interest for the professional student
of legal antiquities, Maitland's papers upon Trust and
Corporation possess an enduring value by reason of
the fine touches of legal and historical perception
which are scattered so freely through them. A collection
of acute and brilliant observations might without
difficulty be made from this as from any other portion
of his historical work. "All that we English people
mean by religious liberty has been intimately connected
with the making of Trusts. Persons who can never be
in the wrong are useless in a Court of law. The making
of grand theories has never been our strong point.
The theory which lies upon the surface is sometimes
a borrowed theory which has never penetrated far,
while the really vital principles must be sought for
in out of the way places. A dogma is of no importance
unless and until there is some great desire within it.
<i lang="la">Quasi</i> is one of the few Latin words that English
lawyers really love. English history can never be an
elementary subject. We are not logical enough to be
elementary." Such phrases, even if detached from
their context, have a life of their own, but they cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
be so detached without the loss of the greater part of
their significance. An epigram may be an extraneous
flourish as irrelevant to all substantial purpose as the
ornament of the bad architect. Maitland's wit was
seldom otiose; it was a shining segment in the solid
masonry of argument.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1907 Maitland delivered the
Rede Lecture at Cambridge, choosing for his theme
English Law and the Renaissance. It was his object
to show how, when Humanism was reviving the study
of Roman law, when Roman law was expelling German
law from Germany and winning victories over the relics
of Anglo-Norman custom in Scotland, England succeeded
in preserving her medieval law books despite
their bad Latin and their worse French. The secret
was to be found in an institution peculiar to this
country, in the existence of the Inns of Court.
"Unchartered, unprivileged, unendowed, without remembered
founders, these groups of lawyers formed
themselves, and in course of time evolved a scheme
of legal education; an academic scheme of the
medieval sort, oral and disputatious.... We may well
doubt whether aught else would have saved English
law in the age of the Reception." But the lecture,
though based upon minute enquiries, was not purely
historical. After pointing out that a hundred legislatures
were now building on that foundation of English
law&mdash;"the work which was not submerged"&mdash;Maitland
surveyed the prospects for the future and pronounced
that the unity of English law was precarious. Queensland
had made her own penal code in 1895; other
colonies might follow in the same way. The Germans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
"by a mighty effort of science and forbearance," had
unified their law upon a national and historical basis.
Might not the British Parliament endeavour to put
out work which would be a model for the British
world? "To make law that is worthy of acceptance
for free communities that are not bound to accept it,
this would be no mean ambition. <i lang="la">Nihil aptius, nihil
efficacius ad plures provincias sub uno imperio retinendas
et fovendas.</i> But it is hardly to Parliament that one's
hopes must turn in the first instance." Certain ancient
and honourable societies, proud of a past that is unique
in the history of the world, may become fully conscious
of the heavy weight of responsibility that was assumed
when English law schools saved, but isolated, English
law in the days of the Reception. "In that case the
glory of Bruges, the glory of Bologna, the glory of
Harvard, may yet be theirs." The lecturer paused,
and then surveying the crowded Senate House added,
with an effect which those who heard him cannot forget,
certain words which have not been printed. "But," he
concluded, "I see, Mr Vice-Chancellor, that strangers
are present."</p>

<p>With health so broken that even the summers in
England seldom passed without periods of illness and
pain Maitland embarked upon one of the great undertakings
of his life, an edition of the <cite>Year Books of
Edward II</cite>. "These Year Books are a precious
heritage. They come to us from life. Some day they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
will return to life once more at the touch of some great
historian." The spirit in which Maitland approached
the work is indicated by two quotations, the first from
Roger North, the second from Albert Sorel, which are
printed on the title page of each volume. "He
(Sergeant Maynard) had such a relish of the old Year
Books that he carried one in his coach to divert him
in travel, and said he chose it before any comedy."
"C'est toute la tragédie, toute la comédie humaine que
met en scène sous nos yeux l'histoire de nos lois. Ne
craignons pas de le dire et de le montrer." The edition
of these Year Books printed in the reign of Charles II.
from a single inferior manuscript was imperfect and
bad. Maitland determined to show how an edition
should be made, and in his eyes no labour was too
great for such a task. These records were unique,
priceless, imcomparable. "Are they not the earliest
reports, systematic reports, continuous reports, of oral
debate? What has the whole world to put by their
side? In 1500, in 1400, in 1300, English lawyers were
systematically reporting what of interest was said in
Court. Who else in Europe was trying to do the like,
to get down on paper and parchment the shifting argument,
the retort, the quip, the expletive? Can we, for
example, hear what was really said in the momentous
councils of the Church, what was really said in
Constance and Basel, as we can hear what was really
said at Westminster long years before the beginning of
'the conciliar age'?" The Year Books contained
more medieval conversation than had survived in any
other authentic source. The history of law could not
be written without them. "Some day it will seem a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
wonderful thing that men once thought that they could
write the history of medieval England without the
Year Books."</p>

<p>The Reports began in 1285, and from 1293 the
stream was fairly continuous. "This surely is a
memorable event. When duly considered it appears
as one of the great events in English History.
To-day men are reporting at Edinburgh and Dublin,
at Boston and San Francisco, at Quebec and Sydney
and Cape Town, at Calcutta and Madras. Their
pedigree is unbroken and indisputable. It goes back
to some nameless lawyers at Westminster to whom
a happy thought had come. What they desired was
not a copy of the chilly record, cut and dried, with
its concrete particulars concealing the point of law:
the record overladen with the uninteresting names of
litigants and oblivious of the interesting names of
sages, of justices, of sergeants. What they desired
was the debate with the life-blood in it, the twists
and turns of advocacy, the quip courteous and the
countercheck quarrelsome. They wanted to remember
what really fell from Bereford, C. J., his proverbs,
his sarcasms: how he emphasised a rule of law by
<cite>Noun Dieu</cite> or <cite>Par Seint Piere</cite>! They wanted to
remember how a clever move of Sergeant Herle
drove Sergeant Toudeby into an awkward corner,
or how Sergeant Passeley invented a new variation
on an old defence: and should such a man's name
die if the name of Ruy López is to live?"</p>

<p>Maitland lived to complete three volumes of the
Year Books. The French was printed on one side of
the page, a translation executed in terse and faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
English on the other. Those who were familiar with
the work of the Literary Director of the Selden Society
had no cause for surprise at the exquisite finish of the
editing. They were prepared for an elaborate <i lang="la">apparatus
criticus</i>, for a careful account of the manuscripts,
and for such notes as might be requisite to explain
allusions and to elucidate obscurities. The great
discovery, that the Reports were not official records
but the private note books of law students, was so
entirely in Maitland's happy and characteristic vein,
that, although no one else had earned the title to
make it, it was quite natural that it should be made
by him. But there was one feature in the Introduction
to the first volume which startled even his admirers.
The editor took occasion to settle the grammar and
syntax of the Anglo-French language, its nouns and
its verbs, its declensions and its tenses. His friends
had known him as lawyer, historian, diplomatist,
paleographer, and no exhibition of excellence in any
one of these departments would have afforded them
the slightest sensation of novelty; but they had not
divined in him the philologist and grammarian.</p>

<p>In answer to surprised congratulations, he said,
with the quick sparkle of humour which his friends
knew so well, that he would go down to posterity as
the author of "Maitland's law"; he had discovered
that such few Anglo-French verbs as possessed "an
imperfect on active service" rarely employed their
preterites. The experts in medieval French have
applauded the work, and the editors of the <cite>Cambridge
History of English Literature</cite> have thought good to
reprint it. In the course of a winter spent under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
blue sky Maitland had made a really important contribution
to medieval philology. And yet, far as he
carried his investigations into the forms, the structure,
and the orthography of the language which he found
in his manuscripts of the fourteenth century, philology
was not the primary object of his quest. He wished to
edit his text as well as it was capable of being edited,
and to provide guidance for those who should take up
the work when he was no longer there to direct it.
The French text of the Year Books was full of
abbreviations which could not be expanded unless the
forms of the language were accurately ascertained.
Maitland therefore applied himself to learn whatever
might be learned about them. The work was
pioneer work, very minute and laborious, but for
Maitland a labour of love. The men who wrote this
forgotten and unexplored language were often clumsy
and careless scribes. Their spelling was full of
vagaries; there was no word so short but that they
would spell it in several ways; through neglect of
the "e" feminine they lost not entirely but very largely
their sense of gender; they would murder the infinitive;
they coined strange terminations out of misunderstood
contractions; but they were using a living tongue to
describe law that was alive; and if in some ways a
fine language degenerated in the current usage of the
English Courts, healthy processes were at work determining
the use of words, processes which it was worth
while to watch with some narrowness, for if thought
fashions language, language in turn reacts upon
thought.</p>

<p>"Let it be that the Latin and French were not
of a very high order, still we see at Westminster a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
cluster of men which deserves more attention than
it receives from our unsympathetic, because legally
uneducated, historians. No, the clergy were not the
only learned men in England, the only cultivated men,
the only men of ideas. Vigorous intellectual effort
was to be found outside the monasteries and universities.
These lawyers are worldly men, not men of
the sterile caste; they marry and found families, some
of which become as noble as any in the land; but they
are in their way learned, cultivated men, linguists,
logicians, tenacious disputants, true lovers of the nice
case and the moot point. They are gregarious, clubable
men, grouping themselves in hospices, which
become schools of law, multiplying manuscripts, arguing,
learning and teaching, the great mediators between
life and logic, a reasoning, reasonable element in the
English nation."</p>

<p>Meanwhile health was failing and gaps were being
made in the circle of his most intimate friends. Henry
Sidgwick, the revered master of philosophy, went first,
then Lord Acton, finally, in 1904, Leslie Stephen.
Some words which Maitland spoke of Henry Sidgwick
have already been quoted in this memoir; they are
passionate in the intensity of their affection and regard.
Acton was a friend of less ancient standing, who by
his high character and vast learning had conquered
Maitland's unreserved enthusiasm; the loss of Leslie
Stephen was mourned as that of a near relative. Of
these deaths one was a possible and the other an actual
cause of some deviation from Maitland's appointed
course of legal work. Upon the vacancy in the
Cambridge Chair of Modern History which occurred
in 1902, Maitland was invited by Mr Balfour to succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Acton. The appointment would have been applauded
throughout the historical world, but Maitland felt that
his health was too precarious to admit of his undertaking
the labours of a new Chair. Besides, there
were the Year Books; there were the illusive and
fascinating subtleties of the <i lang="la">persona ficta</i>. He would
not lightly abandon the law. <i lang="la">Nolumus leges Angliæ
mutare</i>, he wrote to a friend, with a slight variation on
the classic words of those English barons who in the
reign of Henry III. resisted the introduction of a
foreign usage. The decision was doubtless wise, but
the continuity of Maitland's legal work was not
destined to remain unbroken. Leslie Stephen had
expressed a wish that, if any appreciation of him were
published, it should be done by Maitland. "He, as I
always feel, understands me." Such a call could not
be neglected, and so the Year Books were laid aside,
or rather the pace was slackened, while Maitland
laboured with loving and scrupulous diligence upon
the <cite>Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen</cite>.</p>

<p>To those who knew Leslie Stephen best the
biography has seemed to be a true and vivid picture
of the man; yet the work was undertaken with many
misgivings, and gave cause for much anxiety. In the
editing of the Year Books Maitland was exercising
his own familiar craft, and doing what no other living
man could do so well; but the writing of biography
was new ground, and Maitland felt uncertain of his
powers. The task was rendered more difficult by the
depth of Maitland's affection for Stephen, and by his
scrupulous anxiety to write down no epithet or adverb
which would have seemed to Stephen himself to be
excessive. Then there were the thousand and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
little questions of taste and judgment which always
confront the biographer. Should such a passage be
omitted in deference to so and so's feelings? Will
such and such a letter, interesting though it be to an
intimate friend, commend itself to the chance reader?
A man in the full tide of vigour might have shouldered
the labour without a twinge of self-criticism, but
Maitland, who was very ill and full of a most delicate
and sensitive modesty, felt the burden of responsibility.
"He is too big for me for one sort of writing and too
dear for another," he wrote to a friend; and only when
a considerable portion of the book had received the
approval of relatives did he begin to experience a
sensible measure of relief. The steady appreciation of
Miss Caroline Stephen, and some warm words written
by Lady Ritchie, brought him peculiar pleasure.</p>

<p>The <cite>Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen</cite> appeared
in the autumn of 1906, and reviews were steadily
flowing in when the Downing household began to make
preparations for its annual pilgrimage across the sea.
Maitland, who was greatly relieved at the publication
of his book, and at its friendly reception in the press,
seemed to have recovered something of his old buoyancy.
He pushed on an edition of Sir Thomas Smith's
<cite>De Republica Anglorum</cite>, which a pupil was undertaking
at his instigation and under his supervision, and renewed
his attack upon the Year Books. For some
years past he had been concerned with the prospect
of finding a trained scholar who would be capable of
carrying on the work when he was no longer there
to direct it. In a foreign university a man of
Maitland's power would have created a school; young
men from all parts of the country would have clustered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
round him to learn paleography and law French, and
the elements of social and legal history, and the zeal of
the class would have atoned for any deficiency in numbers.
But the climate of the English University is
not favourable to the production of finished historical
technique. We are an economical race, and since
advanced work does not pay in the Tripos, or in the
careers to which the Tripos serves as a portal, it is
left to the casual patronage of amateurs. Maitland
thoroughly understood the practical limitations under
which an English professor must work. He gave
courses of lectures which were expressly adapted to
the general needs of the undergraduates, and were
attended by all the law students in the University,
but interspersed these general courses with others of
a more special character, designed to interest the real
historical student. Thus, in 1892 and 1894, he held
classes for the study of English Medieval Charters,
and this instruction in paleography and diplomatic was
repeated in 1903, 1904 and 1905. In sixty hours
spent over facsimiles Maitland contended that he could
turn out a man who would be able to read medieval
documents with fluency and exactitude.</p>

<p>But with two exceptions the contributors to the
volumes of the Selden Society were not drawn from
the ranks of Maitland's Cambridge pupils, and the
completion of the fourth volume of the Year Books
was undertaken by a distinguished scholar, who, though
he would be the first to admit that he had learnt much
of his craft from Maitland, was never an academical
pupil in the strict sense of the term.</p>

<p>One Cambridge disciple there was, who, under
Maitland's guidance, attained to rare distinction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Miss Mary Bateson was writing essays for Maitland
while he was Reader in English Law, and at that
early period impressed him with the thoroughness and
grasp of her knowledge. Under Maitland's direction
Miss Bateson became one of the best medievalists in
England. Her industry rivalled that of her master;
her judgments were sane and level, and in the art of
historical editing she acquired almost all that Maitland
could teach her. Articles and volumes flowed from
her pen, all of them good, but best of all the two
volumes upon Borough customs, published by the
Selden Society in 1904 and 1906, and owing much
"to the counsel and direction of Professor Maitland."
Then very suddenly, in the late autumn of 1906,
Miss Bateson died. Maitland was already preparing
to sail for the Canaries, whither his wife and elder
daughter had preceded him. The loss of Miss Bateson
affected him deeply. He found time to write two
short notices for the Press, speaking of qualities which
had impressed him, "the hunger and thirst for knowledge,
the keen delight in the chase, the good-humoured
willingness to admit that the scent was false, the eager
desire to get on with the work, the cheerful resolution
to go back and begin again, the broad good sense and
the unaffected modesty," and then embarked for Southampton.
Friends who saw him upon the eve of his
departure spoke of him hopefully: for judged by his
own frail standard he seemed to be well. Then came
a telegram announcing his death. On the voyage out
he had developed or contracted pneumonia, and being
alone and ill-cared for, arrived at Las Palmas desperately
ill. His wife flew down from the villa which
she had prepared against his coming, but the malady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
had obtained too firm a hold, and he died on December
19, 1906, at Quiney's Hotel. His body lies in the
English cemetery at Las Palmas. At the time of his
death he was fifty-six years of age.</p>

<p>He was not without honour in his own generation.
In that inclement December five invitations travelled
out to Las Palmas,&mdash;from the University of Oxford that
he should deliver the Romanes lecture, and from the
United States of America that he should lecture at
the Lowell Institute, at Harvard, and at the Universities
of Columbia and Chicago. Academic honours had
come to him in plenty. Cambridge and Oxford, Glasgow,
Moscow and Cracow gave him their honorary degrees.
He was corresponding member of the Royal Prussian
and of the Royal Bavarian Academies, distinctions
rarely conferred upon English scholars, an honorary
Fellow of his old College, Trinity, an honorary Bencher
of Lincoln's Inn, an original Fellow of the British
Academy. The newly established bronze medal of the
Harvard Law School was awarded to him in the last
days of his life, and on the news of his death movements
were set on foot at each of the great English
Universities to do honour to his memory. At a public
meeting held in the Hall of Trinity College, Cambridge,
on June 1, 1907, and addressed by some of
the most eminent representatives of English learning
it was resolved that "a Frederic William Maitland
Memorial Fund should be established for the promotion
of research and instruction in the history of law
and legal language and institutions, and that this
should be supplemented by a personal memorial to
be placed in the Squire Library of the University<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
At Oxford some students of law and history contributed
to form a library of legal and social history
to be called the Maitland Library, and to be connected
with the Corpus Chair of Jurisprudence now held by
Professor Vinogradoff. By the kindness of the
Warden and Fellows of All Souls a room was lent
to the Maitland Library in the front quadrangle of the
College, and there the student may find Maitland's
own copy of <cite>Domesday Book</cite>, together with many
other volumes which had been in his possession and
which bear the traces of his usage. As a token of his
respect for Maitland's memory, and to further the
skilled editing of a valuable repertory of knowledge,
Mr Seebohm has presented to the Maitland Library
his famous manuscript of the Denbigh Cartulary, one
of the cardinal authorities for the history of Welsh
land-tenures, and an edition of this collection of documents,
executed by the pupils of the Corpus professor,
will be the most appropriate tribute to Maitland's
example in a University in which he might have been,
but was not, an adopted son.</p>

<p>Lord Acton once spoke of "our three Cambridge
historians, Maine, Lightfoot, Maitland," each a pioneer
in his own region of research, and each a name of
significance for universal history. Maitland was not
a Conservative like Maine, or a Churchman like
Lightfoot; he was simply a scientific historian, with
a singularly open and candid mind, and with a detachment
almost unique from the prejudice of sect
or party. In politics he would have ranked himself
as a Liberal Unionist, though his mind was far too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>independent to bear the strain of party allegiance and
led him to differ upon some important questions from
the principles upheld by the Unionist government.
Thus he was in favour of what is called "the secular
solution" in education, and tried, but without success,
to think well of the policy which brought about the
South African War. The Protectionist reaction excited
his disapproval, and he joined a Free Trade Committee
in Cambridge: but he rarely spoke of politics, and like
all men of the scientific temperament had small interest
in the party game, and no little diffidence as to his
power of reaching solid conclusions upon questions
which he had not the leisure thoroughly to explore.
But upon matters which affected the interests
of knowledge and education his views were firm and
clear-cut.</p>

<p>His place in the history of English law has been
summarized by Professor Dicey with an authority to
which I can make no pretence. "Maitland's services
to law were at least threefold. He demonstrated in
the first place what many lawyers must have suspected,
that law could contribute at least as much to history as
history could contribute to law. Now that the truth of
this assertion has been proved it seems a commonplace
to insist upon it. But if one looks at the works of
our best historians, even of so great an historian as
Macaulay, who had rare legal capacity, and who had
extensive knowledge from some points of view of
English law, one is astonished to observe how small
a part law was made to play in the development of the
English nation, which had been, above all, a legal-minded
nation. The doctrine that law was an essential
part of history needed not only asserting&mdash;we could all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
probably have done this&mdash;but demonstrating. The
needed demonstration has been made by Maitland,
and will not be forgotten. Maitland's second achievement
is this: law ought to be, but hitherto in England
has not been, a part of the literature of England.
Among Maitland's predecessors two men living in
different ages have done their best to make law a part
of the literature of England. You will forgive me for
commemorating, as in my case is almost a matter of
private duty, the noble effort made by Blackstone to
give law its rightful position in the world of letters.
Blackstone failed, not by any weakness of his own, but
because he left no successors. He did as much as a
man could achieve in Blackstone's time. Maitland
himself, I believe, shared this opinion. The next man
who took in hand a book somewhat similar to that
undertaken by Blackstone was Sir Henry Maine. He
achieved a great measure of success. He stimulated
in a way which it was difficult for anyone to realise
who had not read Maine's <cite>Ancient Law</cite> when it first
appeared, public interest in law and jurisprudence. He
gave to the English world a new view of the possibilities
of interest possessed by the study of law. But
his success is not complete. He did not show, as did
Maitland, that even the most crabbed details of English
law might be made part of English literature. The
reason why Maine cannot in this matter stand on the
same level with Maitland is that he did not possess the
qualifications for the third and last of Maitland's great
achievements. No one can say that profound learning
was possessed by either Blackstone or Sir Henry
Maine. But Maitland was a learned historian as well
as a learned lawyer. He therefore could and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
demonstrate that extraordinary learning and research
have no connection whatever with dullness and pedantry,
and that learning may be combined with the most
philosophic and the profoundest views of law which
the mind of man can form<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>."</p>

<p>This sketch will have been written in vain if it fails
to suggest that the world lost in Maitland not only a
great and original scholar but also a nature of singular
charm and beauty. The life of severe scholarship may,
and perhaps often does, dry up the fountains of sympathy,
but this was not the case with Maitland. The
current of his affections ran deep and strong, and so
easily was his enthusiasm fired that he would praise
the books of young authors with a delight which seemed
almost unqualified if they happened to contain any real
merit. No one was more entirely free from self-importance
or from any desire to defend, after they
had become untenable, positions which he had once
been inclined to maintain. He possessed a gift which
is far rarer than it is generally supposed to be, and is
often very imperfectly possessed by learned men, an
intense and disinterested passion for truth, a passion
so pure that he would speak with genuine enthusiasm
of such criticisms of his own work as he judged to be
well founded and to constitute a positive addition to
knowledge. His modesty, both in speech and writing,
was so extreme that it might have been put down to
affectation; but it was an integral part of the temper
which made him great in scholarship. He saw the
vast hive of science and the infinite garden of things,
and knew how little the most busy life could add to
the store; and so, living always in the company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
large projects and measuring himself by the highest
standard of that which is obtainable in knowledge, he
viewed his own acquisitions as a small thing&mdash;a fragment
of light won from a shoreless ocean of darkness.</p>

<p>His peculiar genius lay in discovery. He thought
for himself, wrote a pure nervous English of his own,
and even in the ordinary converse of life gave the
impression of a being to whom everything was fresh
and alive. His style was very characteristic of his
vivid and elastic mind, ranging as it did from grave
eloquence to colloquial fun, and using only the simplest
vocabulary to produce its effects. Conscious theory
or method of style he neither claimed nor cared to
possess; he wrote as the spirit moved him, finding
with astonishing ease the vestment most appropriate
to his thought, and composing with such fluency that
his manuscript went to press almost free of erasures.
The literary and artistic conventions of the hour did
not appeal to him. He never went to picture galleries;
in later life he seldom read poetry, though as a boy he
had been fond of it; and he would profess to be unable
to distinguish a good sonnet when he saw one. Knowing
the thing which he could do best, and judging that
it was worthy of a life, he stripped himself of all superfluous
tastes and inclinations that his whole time and
strength might be dedicated to the work. Even music
had to give way. And yet, though he laboured under
the spur of a most exacting conscience and with every
discouragement which illness and harrowing physical
pain could oppose, it was with a certain blithe alacrity,
as if work, however protracted and monotonous, was
always a delightful pastime. He would sit in an armchair
with a pipe in his mouth and some ponderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
folio propped against his knees, steadily reading and
smoking far into the night, thinking closely, taking no
note, but apparently retaining everything. For a man
who wrote and taught so much his knowledge was
amazing both in range and accuracy; but his panoply
might have been of gossamer so lightly did he bear it,
and those who saw him a few times only may remember
him chiefly for his irrepressible gift of humour, or for
some external features, the fine steady brown eye, the
rich flexible voice, the pale clear cut face seamed with
innumerable lines, which lit up so quickly in the play of
talk. Mr S. H. Butcher, who was in the same year at
Cambridge and of the same college, has spoken the
mind of those who knew him best. "When they think
of him they recall, in the first instance, the delightful
companion, the friend who had himself the genius of
friendship. They think of his humour, overflowing
from his talk and his speeches into what seems to
many the driest regions of legal or antiquarian learning,
and they recall his modesty, his quiet charm and his
essential courtesy of soul<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>." And there was withal
that high spiritual power of abnegation and of purpose
in which the lover of hard won truth attains to his
beatitude. <i lang="la">Res severa est verum gaudium.</i></p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
